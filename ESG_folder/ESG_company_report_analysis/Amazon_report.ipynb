    "## Summary\n",
    "Environment, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) refers to the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business.  These criteria help to better determin the future financial performance of companies (return and risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis extracts text from a ESG report in PDF format from the internet, performs NLP on these information, summaries the key ESG initiatives with WordClouds, TDIDFs and discovers topics by building a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that ESG is a broad topic.  Different companies focus on different aspects of ESG depending on their business operations and culture.  One can potentially ingest more ESG reports from different companies across all sectors and industries to capture relevant ESG topics.  This to be attempted in another analysis."

For a company of \\nthe size and broad scope of Amazon, it’s a big challenge. \\nBut at Amazon, we don’t shy away from big challenges. \\nWe innovate and create. We don’t have all the answers \\ntoday, but we believe in the need to act now.\\n\\nThis is reflected in one of our newest Leadership Principles, \\nintroduced last year: Success and Scale Bring Broad \\nResponsibility. It says that “we are big, we impact the world, \\nand we are far from perfect. We must be humble and \\nthoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. \\nOur local communities, planet, and future generations \\nneed us to be better every day.” We apply our Leadership \\nPrinciples daily—whether we are discussing ideas for new \\ninventions or deciding on the best approach to solve a \\nproblem. Throughout 2021, we embedded the spirit of \\nthis Leadership Principle into our everyday actions and \\ncontinued to make progress on our environmental and \\nsocial commitments.\\n\\nDelivering Progress for the Planet \\n\\nIn 2019, we co-founded The Climate Pledge and made a \\ncommitment to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years \\nahead of the Paris Agreement. We invited others to join \\nus and there are now more than 300 businesses and \\norganizations across 51 industries and 29 countries that \\nhave signed the Pledge, which means we are collectively \\ncoming at the climate crisis from nearly every sector and \\nnearly every angle. \\n\\ndiverse representation in our workforce at the most senior \\nlevels. We’ve helped more than 70,000 Amazon employees \\nlearn new skills and advance their careers as part of our \\nUpskilling 2025 pledge, and we are enabling thousands of \\nhourly employees in 14 countries to earn certificates and \\ndegrees through Amazon Career Choice. Earlier this year, we \\nalso expanded travel reimbursements for our employees in \\nthe U.S. to cover treatment for non-life-threatening medical \\nissues when travel is required, including elective abortion and \\ninfertility, starting in 2022.\\n\\nAs part of our efforts to decarbonize our business, we \\nbecame the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable \\nenergy in 2020, and last year, we reached 85% renewable \\nenergy across our business. We continue to expand our use \\nof zero-emission transportation such as electric delivery \\nvans, cargo bikes, and on-foot deliveries, and in 2021, more \\nthan 100 million packages were delivered to our customers’ \\ndoorsteps globally using zero-emission vehicles. We are also \\ninvesting in nature-based solutions, and last year, we helped \\nto create the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest \\nfinance (LEAF) Coalition—a global initiative of governments \\nand leading companies that has already mobilized $1 billion \\nto protect the world’s tropical rainforests. We will continue \\nto act boldly to address climate change and to invest in \\nsolutions to help meet our commitment to reach net-zero \\ncarbon across our operations by 2040.\\n\\nDelivering Progress for People \\n\\nOur ability to be a force for change on behalf of our planet \\nrelies on diverse perspectives from smart, passionate, \\nand committed people from all backgrounds. In 2021, we \\ncontinued to make progress on our diversity goals, including \\nincreasing the number of Black directors and vice presidents \\nby almost 70%, and we remain committed to increasing \\n\\nIn our communities, we are supporting initiatives to address \\nthe affordable housing crisis—including a commitment of \\nmore than $2 billion from the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, \\nlaunched last year. As of March 2022, these commitments \\nhave already preserved or created 8,000 affordable units to \\nhouse more than 18,000 people. Also last year—in service \\nto people in our communities and supply chain—we signed \\nthe United Nations’ (UN) Women’s Empowerment Principles, \\nwhich offers businesses guidance on ways to promote \\ngender equity in the workplace and global community; we \\ncreated a $150 million Black Business Accelerator program \\nin partnership with our Black Employee Network affinity \\ngroup; and we launched a $12 million, five-year partnership \\nwith the U.S. National Safety Council to uncover new ways \\nto prevent and address musculoskeletal disorders.\\n\\nSince the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early \\n2022, we quickly mobilized to provide humanitarian aid and \\nassistance to the people of Ukraine, including financial and \\nin-kind donations, cloud computing credits, resettlement \\nsupport, and more. We are proud of how our global teams \\ncame together to support this effort and are honored \\nto have been awarded the Ukraine Peace Prize for the \\nsupport AWS has shown the Ukraine government and the \\nUkrainian people.\\n\\nDelivering Progress Every Day \\n\\nWe are proud of the progress we’ve made, but we \\nrecognize we have more to do. Our everyday actions to \\ndeliver progress are in service of achieving long-term, \\nsystemic change that improves the well-being of people, \\ncommunities, and the planet.\\n\\nThe path to achieving some of our goals will be long and \\ncomplex, but we are not deterred. At Amazon, we thrive on \\npushing the boundaries of what’s possible. We are taking \\nthe same tenacity we use to invent and problem solve for \\nour customers and applying it to how we help address some \\nof the world’s biggest challenges. I hope you enjoy learning \\nmore about how we are doing this as you read our 2021 \\nSustainability Report. \\n\\nWith gratitude, \\n\\nKara Hurst\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n4  \\n\\nOur Business\\n\\nAs part of our mission to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, we are \\ncommitted to building a sustainable business for our employees, customers, \\nand communities, including the people that support our entire value chain. \\n\\nOur Operations \\n\\nOur Communities\\n\\nOur Supply Chain\\n\\nOur Customers \\n\\nWe offer access to a wide selection of products \\nsold by us and by third parties across dozens of \\ncategories.

We also launched the Max Your Vax sweepstakes \\nto encourage our front-line operations employees to get \\nvaccinated. We offered a variety of weekly prizes—including \\ntwo $500,000 grand prizes, six $100,000 cash prizes, five \\nnew vehicles valued at $40,000 each, and five vacations each \\nvalued at $12,000 that included 40 hours of paid time off. \\n\\nEmpowering Customers to Manage \\nHealth and Safety\\n\\nThroughout the pandemic, we have invested billions of \\ndollars in the health and safety of our employees and \\ncustomers, including building an in-house COVID-19 testing \\nprogram to ensure front-line employees have access to free, \\nregular testing in the U.S. and the UK. \\n\\nBy January 2021, our national COVID-19 testing lab \\nlocated in Kentucky processed more than 1 million COVID-19 \\ntests \\n for front-line employees from more than 700 testing \\nsites, and provided access to COVID-19 testing to nearly all \\nfront-line employees. At the height of the pandemic, our \\nlabs were processing more than 30,000 tests each day.\\n\\nWe took what we learned from this process to create our \\nown at-home COVID-19 test collection kit \\n for customers. \\nThe tests received Emergency Use Authorization from the \\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration in June 2021, providing \\nan affordable, reliable, and convenient way for customers \\nto test for COVID-19 at home. The kits are processed by \\nAmazon’s in-house laboratory using the diagnostic approach \\nrecommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  \\nand Prevention \\n\\n. \\n\\nOur infrastructure has also been helping scientists gain and \\nshare knowledge of RNA viruses in record time. Diseases \\ncaused by RNA viruses include the common cold, influenza, \\nSARS, COVID-19, hepatitis C, Ebola, rabies, polio, and measles.\\n\\nAn international team of scientists from the Serratus project \\nbuilt a powerful supercomputer on AWS \\n in just eight weeks. \\nThe supercomputer searched almost 6 million publicly available \\nbiological samples for the presence of RNA viruses in less than \\ntwo weeks for $24,000—achieving what would have taken a \\nstandard computer well over 2,000 years and cost at least 10 \\ntimes more. Through this process, the research team used the \\nAWS Cloud to identify more than 130,000 new RNA viruses, \\nincluding nine new coronaviruses, creating a “global viral \\nsurveillance system” that could help prevent future pandemics.\\n\\nA Helping Hand\\n\\nIn early 2021, Amazon took immediate action to help \\naddress the COVID-19 surge in India.

That’s why we \\nco-founded The Climate Pledge, \\na commitment to reach net-zero \\ncarbon by 2040—10 years ahead \\nof the Paris Agreement. Since we \\ncreated the Pledge in 2019, more \\nthan 300 companies have joined \\nAmazon in making this commitment.\\n\\nThe path to decarbonization remains challenging. This \\nis especially true for a business of the size and broad \\nscope of Amazon. We operate businesses—delivery \\nand transportation logistics, physical stores, grocery, \\nmanufacturing, and cloud computing services—that involve \\nmoving products, manufacturing goods, and creating \\ncomputing capacity, all at scale. While some of these \\nbusinesses—including cloud computing and e-commerce—\\noffer greater efficiencies, some are more carbon-intensive \\nendeavors. In reducing their carbon footprint through \\ninvestment and innovation, we will enable even greater \\nefficiency and more-sustainable choices for our customers. \\n\\nAs we work to decarbonize our company, Amazon is growing \\nrapidly. We have scaled our business at an unprecedented \\npace to help meet the needs of our customers through the \\npandemic. From early 2020 to the end of 2021, we created \\nmore than 750,000 full-time and part-time jobs worldwide \\nand doubled the size of the fulfillment network that we \\nhad built over the previous 25 years. At the same time, an \\nincreasing number of companies around the world moved \\ntheir technology to the cloud, gaining significant speed, \\ninnovation, and cost advantages, and AWS grew its revenue by \\n37% year-over-year in 2021. \\n\\nThese developments meant we had to build new facilities—\\nfor both our consumer and cloud businesses—and expand \\nour transportation network. Throughout this growth, we \\nremained focused on improving our efficiency through \\nmore-sustainable solutions, including electric vehicles and \\nalternative fuel options as well as wind and solar power \\nacross our network. In AWS, the team spent considerable \\nresource innovating on power efficiency, removing the \\ncentral Uninterruptible Power Supply from our data center \\n\\ndesign, integrating power supplies into our racks, and \\nutilizing Graviton EC2 instances that use up to 60% less \\nenergy for the same performance than comparable Amazon \\nEC2 instances. \\n\\nWith all of our growth in 2021, our absolute carbon \\nemissions increased by 18% in 2021; however, importantly, \\nour carbon intensity decreased by 1.9%—this is the third \\nyear in a row we’ve seen our carbon intensity decrease. \\nThis measurement quantifies total carbon emissions, in \\ngrams of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e), per dollar of \\ngross merchandise sales (GMS). As companies invest in \\nnew products and services, and their businesses grow \\nsubstantially, the focus should not be solely on a company’s \\ncarbon footprint in terms of absolute carbon emissions, but \\nalso on whether it’s lowering its carbon intensity. Over time, \\ncontinued decreases in carbon intensity can lead to lower \\nabsolute emissions. See the Appendix \\n\\n for our carbon data.\\n\\nWhile we’ve had success cutting emissions from some \\noperations, we are still early in the process of transforming \\nothers. Some actions and investments have immediate \\ncarbon savings, while others will take years to demonstrate \\nresults. The path to net-zero carbon has many obstacles, \\nbut we thrive on big challenges. A few of those big \\nchallenges include: \\n\\n•  Powering our operations with 100% renewable energy  \\n\\nby 2025 \\n\\n•  Developing more-sustainable transportation infrastructure \\n•  Constructing more-sustainable buildings\\n•  Decarbonizing the supply chain \\n\\nPowering Operations With 100% \\nRenewable Energy\\n\\nIn 2021, we reached 85% renewable energy across our \\noperations, and we are on a path to achieve 100% by \\n2025—five years ahead of the original target of 2030. \\nThis transition to 100% renewable energy benefits our \\ncustomers as well. Studies by the international analyst firm \\n451 Research found that moving on-premises computing \\nworkloads to AWS can lower workload carbon footprint by \\nnearly 80% compared to surveyed enterprise data centers. \\nThat number could improve to as high as 96% once AWS is \\npowered with 100% renewable energy—a target we are on \\npath to meet by 2025. AWS’ infrastructure is 3.6 times more \\nenergy efficient than the median of surveyed U.S. enterprise \\ndata centers and up to five times more energy efficient than \\nthe average European enterprise data center. \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n11  \\n\\ntechnologies: Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund—a corporate \\nventure fund that invests in sustainability—recently \\nannounced it has invested in EH2 in the U.S. and Sunfire \\nin Germany, two companies helping to push the green \\nhydrogen industry forward.\\n\\nrenewable energy through a combination of off-site and  \\non-site solar projects. And we plan to achieve Leadership \\nin Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum \\ncertification, the highest sustainability building certification \\nissued by the U.S. Green Building Council. \\n\\nIt will take time to remove carbon emissions from heavy \\ntransportation systems, including ocean shipping, aviation, \\nand trucking. Governments and the private sector need \\nto come together on this important work. Amazon is at \\nthe heart of such industry initiatives and government \\npartnerships, including the Cargo Owners for Zero Emission \\nVessels network (coZEV), the First Movers Coalition, the \\nSustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance Aviators Group (SABA), \\nand the Clean Energy Demand Initiative. \\n\\nWe also continue to innovate with construction techniques to \\nmake our fulfillment centers more sustainable. Many of our \\nfulfillment facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India \\nare powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation \\ncan power up to 80% of the facility’s energy use. As of  \\n2021, 115 of our global fulfillment facilities have rooftop \\nsolar installations.\\n\\nConstructing our AWS data centers also presents challenges \\nrelated to sustainability. Concrete and steel used in \\nconstruction are two of the largest contributors of  \\nembodied carbon in a data center building, and we have \\nmultiple initiatives to reduce their carbon impact. For \\nexample, our design standards now require concrete with a \\n20% reduction in embodied carbon compared with standard \\nconcrete for new U.S. data centers, and we are expanding \\nthis requirement globally. Also, instead of using steel from \\noxygen furnaces that burn coal or gas, we are moving to \\nsteel from electric-arc furnaces, which use scrap steel and \\ncan create steel using renewable energy and up to 100% \\nrecycled content. In 2021, six AWS data centers were \\nconstructed with steel made this way, and we have plans  \\nto build more in the future.\\n\\nDeveloping More-Sustainable \\nTransportation Infrastructure \\n\\nConstructing More-\\nSustainable Buildings \\n\\nReducing carbon emissions in transportation is a complex \\nchallenge for many companies. We plan to make half of \\nour shipments net-zero carbon by 2030, and to do that, we \\nare creating a worldwide fleet of zero-emission vehicles. \\nRight now, the vehicles and charging infrastructure don’t \\nexist at the scale needed to serve customers. We need \\nthe supply to increase dramatically. We have ordered \\n100,000 electric vehicles (EVs) from Rivian, and thousands \\nmore from manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, \\nStellantis, and Mahindra Electric. These orders have sent a \\ndemand signal that is shifting the market to meet not only \\nour needs, but also the needs of other companies around \\nthe world. \\n\\nBusinesses also face the challenge of removing carbon \\nemissions from new building construction. Via The \\nClimate Pledge Fund, Amazon has invested in CarbonCure \\nTechnologies, which enables concrete producers to make the \\nsame high-quality concrete with a lower carbon footprint, \\nand Brimstone Energy, which seeks to make cement carbon-\\nneutral through a process focused on calcium silicate rocks, \\nwhich have no embedded CO2, as well as magnesium \\nspecies, which passively absorb CO2. Amazon is lowering \\nthe carbon footprint of our buildings by using CarbonCure’s \\nsystems and Brimstone Energy cement in some new \\nconstruction, including in Amazon’s second headquarters in \\nVirginia (HQ2). \\n\\nWe announced in November that, in the city of Paris, \\ntwo-thirds of our shipments are delivered using zero-\\nemission transport such as EVs, electric cargo bikes, and \\non-foot deliveries. We also are exploring green hydrogen \\n\\nHQ2 will be a model for sustainable construction. We’ve \\nelectrified the operations of HQ2, eliminating the use of \\nfossil fuels for buildings systems and food service. We have \\ncommitted to powering 100% of HQ2’s operations with \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n12  \\n\\nDecarbonizing the Supply Chain\\n\\nWe Thrive on Big Challenges\\n\\nAmazon utilizes an extensive supply chain to deliver goods \\nand services to our customers. Our carbon accounting \\nprocess addresses all three Scopes of emissions under the \\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol. Since 2019, we have shared the \\nScope 1, 2, and 3 emissions included in our footprint through \\nour annual Sustainability Report, along with a detailed \\ndescription of the comprehensive methodology underlying \\nour calculations. \\n\\nMeasurement is critical as we work toward our goal of net-\\nzero carbon by 2040—we have to measure and understand \\nemissions in order to eliminate them. Like other companies, \\nwe are working to improve the granularity of data available \\nand will continue to seek improvements to our reporting \\nprocesses. We already work with organizations and \\nregulatory bodies around the globe to promote transparent \\nand comparable climate reporting.\\n\\nOne example of this is through our partnership with the \\nWe Mean Business Coalition, a group of nonprofits focused \\non accelerating the transition to a net-zero economy. We \\nsupport the Coalition’s SME Climate Hub—a global initiative \\nthat gives small and medium-sized enterprises, like those \\nin our supply chain, free tools and resources to measure \\nand report their emissions. With the Hub’s support, these \\ncompanies are committing to halve their emissions by 2030 \\nand to reach net-zero by 2050. \\n\\nThe challenges we collectively face on the path to net-zero \\ncarbon are considerable. Many new technologies are  \\nshowing promise in their ability to reduce carbon emissions, \\nbut may still require significant development. We need to \\nboth invent new solutions and scale and drive down the \\ncosts of known solutions. \\n\\nIn 2021, we reached 85% renewable energy across our \\noperations, and we are on a path to achieve 100% by \\n2025—five years ahead of the original target of 2030. \\nProgress is not easy, and we are far from done. However, \\nour success in deploying renewable energy globally provides \\nus with a playbook that we are deploying to tackle big \\nchallenges like transportation, building construction, and \\nsupply chain decarbonization strategies. With our relentless \\nculture of innovation, and a tenacious team of sustainability \\nscientists and professionals, we are committed to reaching \\nour 2040 target. \\n\\nBut we can’t do it alone. We will continue to work with \\npartners in the public and private sectors to drive innovation, \\ntechnology advancements, and global policy change. To the \\npublic sector, we say: We support and encourage policies \\nand public-private partnerships that will help accelerate \\nclimate solutions. And as one of more than 300 signatories \\nto The Climate Pledge, we say to the innovators, scientists, \\nbuilders, and entrepreneurs: Our door is open. We all need to \\ndecarbonize. The work may not make the headlines or bring \\nimmediate rewards, but a challenge like this will never be \\nresolved overnight. These are the hard steps that need to be \\ntaken. We welcome you to join us in finding solutions to this \\nglobal crisis. \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##How Amazon Is Addressing the  \\nGlobal Challenges in Carbon Reduction\\n\\nThe path to decarbonization is incredibly complex, but we thrive on big \\nchallenges.

The \\nmajority of the waste we produce \\ncomes through our customer \\nfulfillment operations, from \\nmaterials that become obsolete in \\nour supply chain, or from surplus \\ninventory, including items that are \\noverstocked, returned, cosmetically \\ndamaged, or near expiration. \\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\nThe best way to reduce waste is to avoid creating it in \\nthe first place, through waste-prevention programs and \\noptimized inventory management. Reuse is the next \\nbest option, and is achieved by repairing, repurposing, \\nand donating usable items—all actions we’ve developed \\nprograms to support. We then rely on recycling and \\ncomposting to enable the recovery of raw materials,  \\nand as a last resort, we seek to recover energy from  \\nany waste material that must be sent to landfill. \\n\\nReimagining the Product Lifecycle \\nThrough Amazon Second Chance \\n\\nThrough Amazon Second Chance \\n, we provide customers \\nwith ways to responsibly retire their products. Customers in \\nthe U.S., UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, \\nand Japan can access a range of services to recycle, repair, \\nor trade in their items, as well as shop for like-new and \\nrefurbished products.

By donating surplus inventory to charitable \\norganizations, we keep usable products out of the waste \\nstream and help strengthen our local communities.\\n\\nMany of our product donations are generated through our \\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) donations program, which \\nautomates the process for Amazon selling partners to donate \\ntheir overstocked or returned items. The service requires no \\nadditional action from selling partners, allowing Amazon to \\neasily scale product donations through our existing logistics. \\n\\nWe distribute the majority of our product donations through \\nGood360, a nonprofit that works with a network of 100,000 \\ncharity partners in the U.S. Through our partnership with \\nGood360, Amazon product donations are distributed to low-\\nincome households, foster families, individuals with special \\nneeds or disabilities, seniors, veterans, immigrants, and more. \\nIn Europe, we partner directly with more than 100 charities \\nand local organizations to distribute product donations. \\n\\nSince 2019, Amazon has contributed more than 100 million \\nproducts to our global charity partners in North America, \\nEurope, Australia, and Japan. We are continuing to expand \\nour product donations program globally by adding new \\nlocations in the Middle East, North Africa, and South America.\\n\\nRedirecting Food Waste\\n\\nAs an online food retailer and an operator of physical grocery \\nstores, Amazon is committed to reducing our food waste \\n\\nCityServe\\n\\nCityServe, based in California, is one example \\nof a Good360 Community Redistribution \\nPartner; it works with a network of local \\nchurches to deliver necessities to thousands \\nof individuals and families.\\n\\nIn 2021, our donations enabled CityServe \\nto provide personal care supplies to more \\nthan 20,000 people. CityServe staff and \\nvolunteers assembled “blessing bags” full \\nof items donated by Amazon, including \\ntoothpaste, toothbrushes, hand towels, and \\ndisposable masks. The bags were distributed \\nto individuals and families without housing. \\n\\nby 50% across our U.S. and Europe operations by 2030. \\nWe became a member of the Food Loss and Waste 2030 \\nChampions \\n through the U.S. Environmental Protection \\nAgency in 2020, and extended our commitment to reducing \\nfood waste to our Europe operations in 2021. To achieve \\nthis, we are optimizing our food inventory management \\nsystems to minimize waste from the outset and prioritizing \\nways to avoid landfills.\\n\\nWherever possible, we donate surplus food to individuals and \\nfamilies who need it most through community redistribution \\nprograms. In 2021, we donated 85 million pounds of \\nfood—equivalent to more than 70 million meals—through \\nFeeding America in the U.S. Feeding America is a network \\nof food banks, pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other \\ncommunity-based agencies that helps Amazon maximize the \\nimpact of our food donations. In Europe, we donated more \\nthan 4,000 tons of food—equivalent to 10 million meals—in \\n\\n2021. All of our UK grocery stores have a donation  \\npartner in place that helps deliver surplus food to charities \\naround London. Similarly, all of our U.S. grocery stores have \\na donation partner. \\n\\nFor food that can’t be donated, we turn to processes \\nthat avoid landfills, such as composting and anaerobic \\ndigestion. In 2021, we diverted 27,000 tons of food through \\ncomposting and anaerobic digestion across our worldwide \\noperations. All Amazon Fresh stores operating in the U.S. \\nhave composting programs for food that cannot be donated, \\nand we are expanding our on-site composting capabilities \\nacross our facilities.\\n\\nAt our Whole Foods Market stores, we have active \\ncomposting programs at nearly 470 locations and collectively \\ndiverted more than 155,000 tons of food waste by the \\nend of 2021. Another 2,775 tons of food waste were sent \\n\\nto anaerobic digestion facilities through an organic waste \\nrecycling system called Grind2Energy. The Grind2Energy \\nsystem has helped to divert 12,500 tons of food waste at \\nWhole Foods Market stores since 2014. As a result, we have \\nprevented nearly 9,000 metric tons of CO2e from entering \\nthe atmosphere and produced enough clean, renewable \\nenergy to power over 2,500 U.S. homes for a month. \\n\\nRecycling Solutions Across \\nOur Operations\\n\\nCorrugated board is the most common material that \\nflows through our fulfillment center operations, and we \\nwork with third-party recycling haulers to remove excess \\ncorrugate from our facilities for off-site recycling. Many \\nof these haulers also supply Amazon with the packaging \\nmaterials that we use for customer shipments, converting \\nwaste material recovered from Amazon operations into \\nnew, recycled packaging.\\n\\nNot all the materials we use can be easily recycled with \\ncurrent systems, so we look for innovative solutions to \\nrecycle these challenging materials. One example is plastic \\nfilm, which is not commonly accepted through municipal \\nrecycling programs. We have on-site plastic film recycling \\nsystems at many Amazon operations facilities across North \\nAmerica and Europe, enabling us to convert plastic film into \\nbags made of 100% recycled material.\\n\\nWe continue to explore alternative solutions for other \\nmaterials that are challenging to recycle. In 2021, we \\ncompleted a pilot to recycle and repair damaged bags used to \\nsort and stow items in our fulfillment operations into reusable \\nmaterials. Additionally, we work with our shipping label \\nsuppliers in several European locations to recycle the silicone \\nbacking paper from shipping labels to make new ones. \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Improving Our \\nPackaging \\n\\nPackaging plays a critical role in \\nthe customer delivery experience, \\nand Amazon is committed to \\ndelivering products safely and \\nsustainably. Since 2015, we have \\ninvested in materials, processes, \\nand technologies that have reduced \\nper-shipment packaging weight \\nby 38% and eliminated over \\n1.5 million tons of packaging.\\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\nAmazon customers want right-sized, recyclable packaging \\nthat minimizes waste and ensures damage-free delivery. \\nWe work to reinvent and simplify our sustainable packaging \\noptions using a science-based approach that combines \\nlab testing, machine learning, materials science, and \\nmanufacturing partnerships to scale sustainable change \\nacross the packaging supply chain.\\n\\nEliminating Packaging Where Possible\\n\\nFrustration-Free Packaging (FFP) \\n is Amazon’s flagship \\nprogram designed to reinvent the packaging experience. \\nFFP products offer more-sustainable packaging that is \\neasy to open, fully recyclable, and capable of shipping \\nwithout additional packaging protection. In 2021, we began \\noffering incentives to vendors that convert their packaging \\nto FFP to encourage more vendors to adopt these best-in-\\nclass standards. We also offer additional incentives when \\nthose changes include reductions in total cubic volume. \\nThis generates less packaging waste for customers and \\nenables more packages per delivery vehicle. By the end \\nof 2021, more than 2 million products qualified under \\nour FFP programs. \\n\\n2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n28  \\n\\nPartnering for Better Packaging\\n\\nSome products are more difficult to ship than others. \\nStemware, for example, is fragile and frequently arrives \\nwith multiple layers of padding to prevent damage. This \\nadditional material can make for a frustrating customer \\nexperience and doesn’t always protect the product.\\n\\nTo demonstrate that e-commerce packaging can be \\nboth minimal and effective, we facilitated a complete \\nredesign of stemware packaging for Lenox, a well-\\nknown brand that has specialized in tableware and \\nglassware for over 130 years. \\n\\nThis novel packaging design includes changing product \\norientation to optimize for space. It also includes a \\nprotective corrugate insert, replacing the need for \\nbubble wrap, further reducing plastic waste and \\nimproving the customer experience. The result is a fully \\nrecyclable package that uses 83% less material weight \\nand 78% less volume without compromising protection \\nof the item inside.\\n\\nCold Groceries, Delivered \\nMore Sustainably \\n\\nIn 2021, U.S. grocery teams launched new curbside-\\nrecyclable packaging to replace nonrecyclable insulation \\nthat protects chilled items in grocery deliveries. This has \\neliminated the annual need for 1,500 tons of natural \\ncotton fiber and 7,500 tons of nonrecyclable mixed \\nplastic that was previously required to safely deliver \\nchilled or frozen groceries from Amazon Fresh and \\nWhole Foods Market.\\n\\nIt is particularly challenging to design new solutions \\nthat maintain adequate insulation properties to keep \\nproducts chilled. Our innovative packaging uses layers \\nof  tissue to provide both durability and insulation \\nwithout sacrificing recyclability. \\n\\nCustomers were with us for every step of this journey.\\n\\nLearn more about how we tested this packaging in \\nseveral U.S. cities and incorporated improvements into \\nthe design based on customer feedback \\n\\n.\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n29  \\n\\nOptimizing Materials Where \\nPackaging Is Necessary\\n\\nWhen additional Amazon packaging is required to ship a \\nproduct, we strive to optimize that packaging for increased \\nrecyclability along with reduced waste and carbon. We are \\ntransitioning to materials that are compatible with local \\npaper and plastic recycling streams where we operate. We \\nalso support initiatives to expand the availability of curbside \\nrecycling infrastructure to the public through investments in The \\nRecycling Partnership and the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund. \\n\\nIn the U.S., we expanded the use of our recyclable paper \\npadded mailer, replacing nearly 70% of our mixed material \\nbubble mailers in 2021. We also improved the composition \\nof our single-use plastic packaging to use less material and \\nincorporate more recycled content. In 2021, we increased the \\nrecycled content of our plastic film bags from 25% to 50% \\nand that of our plastic padded bags from 15% to over 40%. \\nThrough these collective efforts, we avoided over 30,000 tons \\nof plastic across North America in 2021.\\n\\nIn Europe, we switched from single-use plastic delivery bags \\nto recyclable paper delivery bags and cardboard envelopes \\nfor orders shipped from fulfillment centers in 2021. We also \\nremoved a wide range of single-use plastic products from \\nour European stores. In Australia, we replaced all single-use \\nair pillows with 100% recyclable paper material to protect \\ngoods during shipping. Amazon also became a founding \\nmember of the India Plastics Pact after removing single-use, \\nthin film plastics from Amazon packaging throughout India \\nfulfillment centers in 2020. \\n\\nUsing Technology to Optimize \\nPackaging Type and Fit\\n\\nWe use a range of boxes and mailers across our fulfillment \\nnetwork, and for every shipment that requires packaging, we \\nuse science-based systems to determine optimal packaging \\nsizes and types. This starts with using machine learning \\nto identify products that can be delivered safely with less \\nmaterial. Machine learning algorithms help us determine \\n\\nwhen smaller products are suitable for flexible packaging, \\nsuch as padded mailers and bags, which are up to 75% \\nlighter than similar-sized boxes. Over the past five years, \\nthese algorithms have allowed us to reduce the use of \\ncorrugated boxes by over 35%.\\n\\nIn 2021, we deployed data-science algorithms to optimize \\nthe number and size of boxes used for 12 geographies \\naround the world. These algorithms—which help our \\nfulfillment centers maintain the right mix of box sizes— \\nnow cover 65% of global box shipments, with plans to  \\nscale to 97% in 2022.\\n\\nWe also introduced advanced fitting algorithms designed \\nto reduce packaging specifically for shipments with \\nmultiple items. These new algorithms calculate the \\npossible arrangements of products for best fit in a three-\\ndimensional virtual package. Since launch, this technology \\nhas downgraded the size or type of packaging for 7% of \\ntotal  shipments and we plan to deploy it globally in 2022.\\n\\nOur Fulfillment Packaging Breakdown in 2021\\n\\nCorrugated\\n\\nFlexibles\\n\\n43% of shipments\\n\\n49% of shipments\\n\\nLower Waste\\n\\nShipment Zero Packaging\\n\\n8% of shipments\\n\\nlocker\\n\\nBoxes\\n\\nlocker\\n\\nlocker\\n\\nPadded \\nMailer\\nlocker\\n\\nlocker\\n\\nFlexible \\nMailers\\n\\nPaperboard \\nEnvelopes\\n\\nUnpadded \\nBags\\n\\nRecyclable Paper \\nPadded Mailer\\n\\nNo Amazon \\nPackaging\\n\\nlocker\\n\\nAlgorithm Packaging Efficiencies\\n\\nSize with old algorithm\\n2,133 inch3\\n\\nSize with new algorithm\\n1,393 inch3\\n\\n34.7% \\nExternal cube \\n\\nreduction\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n30  \\n\\nAdditionally, in 2021, we launched 17 features and \\nexperiments to increase the discoverability of Climate Pledge \\nFriendly products.

We expect our suppliers to uphold the Five Freedoms \\nframework for animal welfare, which mandates freedom \\nfrom hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom \\nfrom pain, injury, or disease; freedom to express normal \\nbehavior; and freedom from fear and distress. We expect \\nour suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and to take \\na zero-tolerance approach to animal cruelty, abuse, and \\nneglect. We encourage suppliers to continuously improve \\ntheir animal welfare standards and practices, and to work \\ntoward recognized animal welfare certifications or industry \\nguidelines that include welfare provisions. For information \\nabout animal welfare at Whole Foods Market, see our  \\nMeat Department Quality Standards \\n\\n. \\n\\n  Cocoa, Coffee, and Tea \\n\\nAmazon is committed to sourcing cocoa, coffee, and tea \\nthat is certified against sustainability standards by Rainforest \\nAlliance or Fairtrade International for our grocery Amazon \\nPrivate Brands2 selection in Europe. For cocoa products in \\nEurope, other independently verified third-party schemes \\n(such as Cocoa Horizons) may also be used, subject to review \\nand approval. Most of our Private Brands ground, whole bean, \\nand pods coffee products in North America are also certified \\nby Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade International, or Fair Trade \\nUSA, and we expect the remaining selection to transition \\nin 2022. \\n\\nAll 365 by Whole Foods Market brand chocolate bars, \\nchocolate chips, and baking chocolate are certified by Fair \\nTrade USA, and in 2021, we transitioned all tea under the \\nsame brand to be certified by either Fair Trade USA or \\nRainforest Alliance. In addition, all 365 by Whole Foods Market \\npackaged coffee is responsibly sourced and certified according \\nto an approved third-party certification, including Rainforest \\nAlliance, Fair Trade USA, or Fairtrade International. Whole \\nFoods Market is also a member of Conservation International’s \\nSustainable Coffee Challenge, a collaborative effort of \\ncompanies, governments, NGOs, research institutions, and \\nothers to transition the coffee sector to be more sustainable. \\n\\n  Cotton\\n\\nWe are striving to source all cotton for our Amazon Private \\nBrands apparel products from more-sustainable sources by \\nthe end of 2022.

They inform, \\nentertain, and connect our customers, and we are working \\nhard to make our devices more sustainable. That includes \\nhelping customers reduce their impact on the environment \\nthrough our products and services. \\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\nWe design our devices to be more sustainable by measuring \\nand reducing carbon emissions at all stages of the product \\nlifecycle, from how the devices are made to how they are \\nused and ultimately disposed of. We extend our impact \\nby delivering products and experiences to help customers \\nmanage their own environmental impact. \\n\\n  Materials and Chemicals\\n\\nWe incorporate recycled materials into many new Amazon \\ndevices. In 2021, we launched several Echo, Fire TV, Fire \\nTablet, Kindle, and Smart Home devices and accessories \\nthat include up to 60% recycled molded plastic, up to \\n100% recycled fabrics, up to 100% recycled aluminum, \\nand up to 70% recycled magnesium, depending on the \\nproduct. We also incorporated 50% recycled plastic into \\ncertain power adapters that ship with our devices.\\n\\nTo advance the move to safer chemistry, we joined \\nChemFORWARD \\n as a co-design partner. Through this \\npartnership, we are collaborating with industry peers to \\nproactively identify harmful chemicals and safer alternatives \\nahead of regulations.\\n\\n  Packaging\\n\\n  Reliability\\n\\n  Alexa \\n\\nIn 2020, we committed to making Amazon device packaging \\n100% recyclable by 2023. Additionally, we are working \\nto source 100% of the wood fiber in our packaging from \\nresponsibly managed forests or recycled sources. We have \\nmade significant progress toward our goals, eliminating \\nmore than 29 million plastic bags from our device packaging \\nbetween September 2020 and September 2021. For new \\nEcho, Fire TV Stick, Fire Tablet, and Kindle Paperwhite devices \\nlaunched in 2021, 94%–98% of the packaging is made \\nof wood fiber-based materials from responsibly managed \\nforests or recycled sources, depending on the product. \\n\\n  Energy\\n\\nIn 2020, Amazon became the first consumer electronics \\ncompany to commit to addressing the electricity used by our \\ndevices through renewable energy development, starting \\nwith our Echo devices. We are also making investments \\nin additional wind and solar farm capacity that, by 2025, \\nwill be equal to the energy use of Fire TV and Ring devices \\nworldwide. Combined, we expect these projects will produce \\nover 5 million megawatt-hours of clean energy per year—\\nthat’s enough to power more than 400,000 homes.\\n\\nTo accompany our investments in renewable energy, we also \\ncontinue to make our devices more energy efficient. We have \\nbeen rolling out Low Power Mode to new devices, as well as \\nto older devices already in customers’ homes. By the end of \\n2021, over 50% of all Echo and Fire TV devices in customers’ \\nhomes had Low Power Mode. We also launched a number of \\nnew Fire Tablet, Fire TV, and Amazon Smart Home devices in \\n2021 that were designed for energy efficiency and earned \\nthe ENERGY STAR certification.\\n\\nWe design our devices with best-in-class reliability models so \\nthat they are more resilient, last longer, and don’t need to be \\nreplaced as often. We also release over-the-air software updates \\nfor our customers’ devices with feature and security updates. \\n\\n  Suppliers\\n\\nWe work with our suppliers to encourage sustainability as a \\ntop priority. In 2021, we launched our Zero Waste to Landfill \\nprogram for suppliers. Ten of our supplier sites responsible for \\nthe final assembly of some of our most popular Echo, Kindle, \\nand Fire TV devices achieved UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill Silver \\nor Platinum certification—a significant step toward achieving \\nour zero-waste ambitions. This certification indicates that \\nwaste has been handled in environmentally responsible ways, \\ndiverting more than 90% of a facility’s waste from landfill \\nthrough methods other than waste to energy. \\n\\n  Climate Pledge Friendly\\n\\nWe partner with trusted and transparent external \\ncertifications to validate the sustainability of our products \\nand clearly communicate this to customers with the Climate \\nPledge Friendly label. In 2020 and 2021, our Echo, Fire TV, \\nFire Tablet, Kindle Paperwhite, and Smart Home devices and \\naccessories launched with the Climate Pledge Friendly \\nlabel. Many of these products carry the Carbon Trust’s \\nReducing CO2 certification, demonstrating a reduction \\nin the carbon emissions of a product year over year. The \\nAmazon Smart Thermostat is the first Amazon device to be \\nECOLOGO Silver certified—a certification that demonstrates \\nproducts meet standards that can reduce the environmental \\nimpact of one or more stages of the product lifecycle.\\n\\n  \\n\\n, \\n\\nWe are making it easier for customers to understand their \\nhome energy use with the Alexa energy dashboard \\navailable in the U.S. The dashboard works with compatible \\nsmart lights, plugs, switches, water heaters, thermostats, \\ntelevisions, and Echo devices, allowing customers to easily \\nestimate the energy used by these devices. Customers \\ncan also enable Alexa to help them conserve energy with \\nHunches. For example, if Alexa has a Hunch that a customer \\nis away and forgot to turn off a light, Alexa can automatically \\nturn it off, helping customers save energy and reduce \\ncarbon emissions. \\n\\n  Extending Our Impact\\n\\n, focused on how we are integrating carbon-\\n\\nTo drive change beyond our business, we look for ways to \\nshare learnings and innovations that have shaped the way \\nwe design our products. This allows others to leverage our \\nexpertise and make more-sustainable products for their \\nown customers. In early 2022, we published a paper called \\nDecarbonizing and Neutralizing the Use Phase of Connected \\nDevices \\nreduction strategies across the use phase of our devices. \\nThese strategies account for an estimated 10%–15% of the \\noverall carbon footprint of rechargeable battery-operated \\ndevices and an estimated 60%–80% of the footprint of \\nplugged-in devices. At Amazon, we recognize that we cannot \\nsolve this challenge alone, and we are eager to invite other \\nconsumer electronics companies and connected device \\nmanufacturers to join the mission of driving to a net-zero \\ncarbon use phase. \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n35  \\n\\ndelivered six projects constructed with recycled steel in 2021 \\nand will expand this to all future U.S. and European data \\ncenters moving forward.\\n\\nConcrete also contributes a large share of embodied carbon \\nin data center construction, and AWS has multiple initiatives \\nto reduce the carbon impact of the concrete required. For \\nexample, our design standards now require concrete with a \\n20% reduction in embodied carbon versus standard concrete \\nfor new U.S. data centers, and we are expanding this \\nrequirement globally.\\n\\nSustainability in \\nthe Cloud\\n\\nAWS is the world’s most \\ncomprehensive and broadly \\nadopted cloud offering, with \\nmillions of global users depending \\non it every day. To build a \\nsustainable business for our \\ncustomers and for the world we all \\nshare, we are designing data centers \\nthat provide the efficient, resilient \\nservice our customers expect while \\nminimizing our environmental \\nfootprint—and theirs.\\n\\n3.6x\\n\\nAWS is 3.6 times more \\nenergy efficient than the \\nmedian of U.S. enterprise \\ndata centers surveyed\\n\\n5x\\n\\nAWS is up to five times \\nmore energy efficient than \\nthe average data center \\nsurveyed in Europe\\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\nWe focus on efficiency across all aspects of our infrastructure, \\nfrom the design of our data centers and hardware to \\nmodeling the performance of our operations for continuous \\nenhanced efficiency. We are on a path to power our \\noperations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. These \\nrenewable energy investments help power our data centers, \\nas part of our commitment to reach net-zero carbon across \\nour operations by 2040. \\n\\nFor AWS, operating sustainably also means reducing the \\namount of water we use to cool our data centers. Our holistic \\napproach minimizes both energy and water consumption in \\nour operations and guides the development of our water use \\nstrategy for each AWS Region where we operate. \\n\\nIn addition, we work to reduce the carbon emitted during the \\nextraction, manufacturing, and transportation of materials \\nto data center construction sites. Reducing this embodied \\ncarbon offers a significant opportunity to cut our overall \\nemissions from data centers. \\n\\nEnergy Efficiency\\n\\nWe are using innovation to improve power efficiency in \\nmultiple ways, including our investment in AWS-designed \\nchips and the AWS Nitro System. For instance, AWS-\\ndesigned Graviton3 is our most power-efficient general-\\npurpose processor. Graviton3-based Elastic Compute Cloud \\n(EC2) instances use up to 60% less energy for the same \\nperformance than non-Graviton EC2 instances. With the \\nworld’s increasing need for computing and as machine \\nlearning has become mainstream, continually innovating \\nat the chip level will be critical to sustainably powering the \\nworkloads of the future. \\n\\nAWS also continually innovates on cooling efficiency. For \\nexample, we worked with our vendors to optimize the \\nlongevity and airflow performance of the cooling medium \\nused in our data center cooling systems. The new medium \\nprovides twice the service life and allows air to pass through \\nmore easily than previous iterations, saving fan energy. This \\nhas significant impacts on building energy performance, \\nreducing the energy use of cooling equipment by 20%. \\n\\nPredicting and Tracking Performance\\nWe use advanced modeling methods, such as computational \\nfluid dynamics tools, to optimize our data center design. \\nThis allows us to fully understand how the data center \\nwill perform before it is ever built, enabling us to optimize \\nfor higher reliability and energy efficiency in our systems. \\nOnce our data centers are operational, real-time, physics-\\nbased models allow us to further improve and optimize our \\ndesigns. We build these custom models using AWS services \\nand weather datasets from the Amazon Sustainability \\nData Initiative to predict system performance for our sites \\nand track their performance against how they should \\nbe operating. \\n\\nReducing Embodied Carbon\\n\\nIn addition to emissions from our energy usage, AWS \\naddresses a wide range of indirect emissions—including \\nthose associated with the construction of our data centers. \\nSteel is one of the largest contributors of embodied carbon \\nin the structure of AWS data centers and we are lowering \\nthese emissions by working with mills using electric arc \\nfurnace production processes. Unlike conventional steel \\nproduced from primary materials, coal, and gas, our suppliers \\nare using up to 100% recycled content and are powered by \\nelectricity only, reducing embodied carbon up to 70%. We \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Moving to AWS Can Help Significantly Lower Carbon\\n\\n, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence, have shown that AWS’ \\n\\nStudies by 451 Research \\ninfrastructure is more efficient than on-premises data centers. AWS is 3.6 times more energy \\nefficient than the median of U.S. enterprise data centers surveyed and up to five times more \\nenergy efficient than the average in Europe. A similar study that surveyed organizations in \\nJapan, South Korea, Singapore, Australia, and India found that, on average, moving to the \\ncloud was up to five times more energy efficient than using their on-premises data centers.\\n\\nAfter analyzing several regions, 451 Research also found that AWS can lower customers’ \\nworkload carbon footprints by nearly 80% compared to surveyed enterprise data centers, \\nand up to 96% once AWS is powered with 100% renewable energy—a target we are on \\npath to meet by 2025. \\n\\n2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n36  \\n\\nAWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool\\n\\nAs AWS continues to invest in sustainability across our \\ninfrastructure, many of our customers have asked us \\nto help measure the carbon footprint of their AWS \\nworkloads—both to understand how moving to AWS \\nreduces their carbon footprint and to report their \\noverall footprint.\\n\\nOur new customer carbon footprint tool \\n uses simple \\nvisualizations to show customers their historical carbon \\nemissions, evaluate related trends as their use of AWS \\nevolves, estimate emissions avoided by using AWS \\ninstead of an on-premises data center, and review \\nforecasted emissions based on their current usage. \\n\\nThe forecast shows how customers’ footprints will change \\nas Amazon stays on path to powering our operations with \\n100% renewable energy by 2025, five years earlier than \\nthe original target of 2030, and drives toward net-zero \\ncarbon by 2040.\\n\\nIn addition, historical carbon emissions data is available \\nbased on a customer’s AWS use from January 2020 \\nonward. This data includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 \\nemissions. Scope 1 emissions come directly from a \\ncompany’s operations, while Scope 2 emissions come \\nfrom the generation of purchased energy, such as the \\nelectricity used to power Amazon facilities. \\n\\nThe customer carbon footprint tool uses carbon data \\nthat meets the widely adopted international standard of \\nthe Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which supplies the world’s \\nmost widely used greenhouse gas accounting standards. \\nWhen signed into the AWS Billing console, customers can \\nview their carbon emissions data by geographical location \\nand by AWS service, such as EC2 and Amazon Simple \\nStorage Service (Amazon S3). They can also measure \\nchanges in their carbon footprint over time, as they \\ndeploy new resources in the cloud.\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n37  \\n\\nCommunity Water Programs\\nWater is a key resource we share with those who live where \\nwe operate, so we look for opportunities to return water \\nto these communities. For example, we partnered with the \\nCity of Umatilla and the West Extension Irrigation District \\nto deliver water to farmers in Oregon. Instead of going \\nto a wastewater treatment plant, our clean cooling water \\ngoes into a canal that delivers the water to farmers for use \\nin irrigation. With this project, we reuse up to 96% of the \\nwastewater we discharge from our data centers in this region.\\n\\nIn 2021, we funded watershed restoration efforts by \\nThe Nature Conservancy in Cape Town, South Africa, and \\n\\nSão Paulo, Brazil. These completed projects have restored \\n365 hectares of land and increased water supply availability \\nby 45 million gallons per year.\\n\\nThrough partnerships with Water.org and WaterAid in India \\nand Indonesia, we initially intended to provide clean water to \\n165,000 people. By the time these partnerships concluded in \\nearly 2022, we surpassed our goal and provided clean water \\nand sanitation to over 250,000 community members. In 2022, \\nwe began supporting a new set of projects, which include \\nwetland creation in the Thames River Basin in England and \\nwater quality projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in \\nthe U.S.\\n\\nWater Stewardship in Data Centers\\n\\nAmazon knows water is a precious resource. Our holistic \\napproach minimizes both energy and water consumption \\nin our data center operations and guides our water use \\nstrategy for each AWS Region. This starts with evaluating \\nclimate patterns, local water management and availability, \\nand opportunities to avoid using potable water sources \\nwhenever possible. We are committed to conserving and \\nreusing water, both in our on-site operations and by working \\nwith private and public entities to support water availability \\nin communities where we operate data centers. \\n\\nEvaporative Cooling\\nOur preferred cooling strategy for data centers uses \\nevaporative technologies. We analyze the weather in each \\nregion and monitor our cooling system, which is designed \\nto maximize environmental cooling and minimize water use. \\nDuring the hottest months of the year, we have optimized \\nsystems to minimize water usage. Outside air is cooled \\nthrough an evaporative process and pushed into the server \\nrooms to keep hardware at stable operating temperatures. \\nWith this design, even our largest data centers at full \\ncapacity would use, on average, about the same water in \\na year as only 25 U.S. households. During cooler months, \\nwhere possible, outside air is supplied directly to the data \\ncenter without needing to be cooled.\\n\\nWe are constantly innovating the design of our cooling \\nsystems to further reduce water usage. We are installing \\nsensors that provide real-time water-use data to operators \\nand sustainability teams. By analyzing this data, we can \\nidentify opportunities to reduce water usage and rapidly \\nmake operational changes.\\n\\nRecycled Water\\nWe evaluate the opportunity to reduce our consumption \\nof potable water and are actively expanding our use of \\nnonpotable and recycled water for cooling purposes. In \\ncertain regions, we work directly with utilities and regulators \\nto obtain approval for the use of recycled water in direct \\nevaporative cooling technology. We are continuing to work \\nwith water utilities in various regions to expand this recycled \\nwater infrastructure. Through these actions, we are actively \\ncontributing to sustainable water solutions by reducing \\nour impact on the local potable water supply for the \\ncommunities where we operate.\\n\\nOn-Site Water Treatment\\nWe use on-site, modular water-treatment systems in \\nmultiple regions, which allow us to remove scale-forming \\nminerals and reuse water for more cycles. Increasing our \\n“cycles of concentration” contributes to reducing the water \\nintake needed to cool our data centers.\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n38  \\n\\nAmazon Sustainability Data Initiative \\n\\nThe Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) \\n helps \\nresearchers, scientists, and innovators around the world \\nadvance their work on sustainability-related research.

Dedicated \\nteams across the company focus on establishing open \\ncommunication with our employees, providing them with \\nmeaningful grievance mechanisms and avenues for dialogue \\nwith leadership. Aligning with the UNGP framework, Amazon’s \\npolicies and practices are designed to promote respect for \\nthe rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining \\nand to comply with the legal requirements of the countries \\nwhere we operate.

We are working to \\nbetter understand wage payments in our supply chain to \\nmeaningfully engage with suppliers and enhance our due \\ndiligence under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and \\nHuman Rights on this issue. We will continue to enroll our \\nsuppliers in international programs that improve livelihoods, \\nhelp suppliers invest in worker well-being, and contribute \\nto the social and economic development of regions where \\nwe source and operate. Programs such as SCORE and \\nBetter Work address the holistic challenges workers face by \\nfocusing on improving working conditions and promoting \\nrespect for labor rights. An independent impact assessment \\nof the SCORE program found increased productivity and \\nincreased wages for Amazon suppliers participating in \\nthe program. \\n\\nResponsible Recruitment and Freely \\nChosen Employment \\nAmazon does not tolerate the use of forced labor. Forced \\nlabor is a hidden crime that is hard to combat, and workplace \\nenvironments and recruitment practices are dynamic. For \\nvulnerable groups such as foreign migrant workers, we are \\nincreasing our understanding of forced labor risk across both \\nhome and destination countries. Worker voice mechanisms \\nare important to enable workers to raise issues in a safe \\nand confidential manner. We recognize real progress in this \\nspace will only be achieved through collaborative action—\\nby companies, governments, and civil society—to spur \\nsystemwide change. \\n\\nWith operations and supply chains spanning the globe, we \\nare committed to improving the working conditions of people \\nwho are connected to our business and recognize the need \\nto monitor for conditions that put workers at risk of modern \\nslavery. We work to identify and reduce the risk of forced \\nlabor. Our Supply Chain Standards prohibit all forms of forced \\nlabor and human trafficking, and set requirements aimed at \\nreducing risk. For example, workers must not be required to \\npay recruitment fees, and suppliers must not retain passports \\nor personal documentation. During assessments of Amazon-\\nbranded suppliers, we track where workers migrated from and \\nhow much they paid in recruitment fees. If fees have been paid, \\nwe require the supplier to reimburse workers in full. \\n\\nIn 2021, we expanded our relationships with key external \\npartners RBA and the International Organization for Migration \\n(IOM). We also began partnering with the Issara Institute to \\naddress issues of human trafficking and forced labor through \\nworker voice, partnership, and innovation. We are working with \\nthese organizations to better understand hotspots across our \\nsupply chain so that the rights of workers vulnerable to forced \\nlabor continue to be respected and promoted. We are also \\nworking with them to leverage collective industry responses for \\nimproved due diligence and develop impactful risk mitigation \\nstrategies that put the interests of workers first.\\n\\nAdditionally, we expanded our training on responsible \\nrecruitment practices to over 50 suppliers through the RBA’s \\nResponsible Labor Initiative and IOM. We also offered worker \\nawareness training to workers at sites in high-risk regions to \\nimprove the well-being of foreign migrant workers. These \\ntraining programs focused on modern slavery risks and the \\nimportance of responsible recruitment, including teaching \\nparticipants how to implement effective risk mitigation \\ncontrols, identify issues in their recruitment and hiring processes \\nfor migrant workers, and draft an implementation plan for \\naddressing these issues. \\n\\nStanding in Partnership Against  \\nChild Labor\\n\\nThe UN designated 2021 as International Year for the \\nElimination of Child Labour.

Our aim is to work \\nwith industry partners and our suppliers to understand \\ntheir environmental footprints and set goals to reduce \\nenvironmental impacts. \\n\\nAccess to Effective Grievance Mechanisms\\nWe are building our efforts to provide people connected \\nto our value chain with access to effective grievance \\nmechanisms as part of our supply chain due diligence and \\ninvestments in worker well-being, and have added this as \\na key commitment area. \\n\\nWe help our suppliers work with a number of global partners \\nto provide supply chain workers with access to effective \\ngrievance mechanisms, including the Amader Kotha Helpline \\nin Bangladesh; Ulula in China, Cambodia, India, Pakistan, \\nand the UK; the amfori SPEAK FOR CHANGE Programme \\nin Vietnam; the Responsible Labor Initiative’s Suara Kami \\nhelpline in Malaysia; and Sedex Direct Worker Reporting \\nin India. \\n\\n2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n67  \\n\\nCommodities and Traceability \\n\\nAssessing and Mapping Risk\\nCommodity supply chains are complicated and fragmented, \\nand improved visibility into raw material supply chains better \\nenables businesses to identify human rights and labor rights \\nviolations and hold suppliers accountable. \\n\\nIn 2021, we completed our first commodity and materiality \\nrisk assessment for Amazon-branded products and identified \\neight commodities with salient social and environmental risks \\nas a key milestone in the development of our responsible \\ncommodity sourcing roadmap. \\n\\nFocus on Cotton \\nIn 2021, we continued to strengthen our efforts to address \\nhuman rights risks in global cotton supply chains. Amazon \\njoined Better Cotton’s Retailer and Brand Advisory Panel \\non Traceability to help steer Better Cotton’s initial vision \\nand strategy toward achieving more traceable cotton in \\nthe coming years. We also participated in the Responsible \\nSourcing Network’s initiative YESS: Yarn Ethically & \\nSustainably Sourced. YESS works to address forced labor \\nin the cotton value chain by providing training to, and \\nmanaging the assessment of, spinners and fabric mills to \\nidentify and address forced labor in cotton production. \\n\\nFocus on Minerals \\nIn 2021, we increased our support for industry collaboration \\ntoward responsible mineral sourcing. We remain members \\nof the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals \\nTrade and the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). We also \\nenhanced our cobalt due diligence program using the RMI’s \\ncobalt reporting template.\\n\\nWe supported RMI’s Smelter Audit Fund to increase \\nassessments for tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold smelters. \\nThese assessments are critical to responsible mineral \\n\\nsourcing in our supply chains. In 2022, we will implement \\nadditional smelter due diligence protocols as we work toward \\n100% of tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold mineral smelters \\nand refiners in our supply chain being certified using a \\nrecognized minerals assurance program. \\n\\nPurchasing Practices\\nSupplier feedback on our purchasing practices is important \\nin understanding how we can improve supplier relationships \\nand understanding our potential impact on human rights in \\nour supply chain. In 2021, Amazon partnered with the Better \\nBuying Institute to capture anonymous supplier feedback \\non our purchasing practices through an annual survey. \\nBenchmarked against industry peers, we identified key areas, \\nincluding planning and forecasting, supplier engagement, \\nand on-time payments, where we can improve practices to \\ndrive a better supplier experience of working with Amazon.\\n\\nIn 2021, Amazon partnered with Better Buying and other \\nbrands to create an e-learning course to raise awareness \\nabout the importance of the issue.\\n\\nWe are proud to have been part of the effort to \\nend state-imposed forced labor in Uzbekistan’s \\ncotton sector. In 2019, Amazon signed the \\nCotton Campaign’s Uzbek Cotton Pledge with \\nover 300 brands and retailers to raise awareness \\nand oppose the systemic use of forced labor in \\nUzbekistan’s cotton production. As of March \\n2022, the International Labour Organization has \\nindependently verified that the government of \\nUzbekistan has ended the practice of state-imposed \\nforced labor in its cotton sector and the Cotton \\nCampaign has lifted the Uzbek Cotton Pledge, \\nending the boycott of Uzbek cotton. \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n68  \\n\\nOur assessment data reflects findings for suppliers evaluated \\nin 2019, 2020, and 2021, and includes assessments of \\nsuppliers we no longer work with, or with which we never \\nbegan a business relationship. Assessments may have \\nfound more than one issue listed. We accept assessments \\ncompleted by qualified independent audit firms based \\non our own assessment standards and those of industry \\nassociations, including Sedex, amfori, and RBA; certification \\nstandard Social Accountability International (SA8000); and \\nthe Better Work program. \\n\\nOur assessment data helps us determine where to focus our \\nefforts and resources, and provides insight into industrywide \\nchallenges and systemic issues. We are continually innovating \\nto include new assessment types and data sources in \\nour due diligence program. We attribute the increase in \\ntransparency issues to the 2021 introduction of a remote \\n\\nassessment tool, which requires suppliers to provide records \\nand documentation in real time. We now provide suppliers \\nwith additional notice of this expectation to help preempt \\ntransparency issues. In other cases, the increased rate of \\nfindings in specific categories represents industrywide \\nchallenges that require industry-level, long-term solutions. \\nWe have dedicated teams engaging directly with our \\nsuppliers on key safety-, wage-, and working hours-related \\nfindings. We recognize that we cannot address many of these \\nsystemic issues alone, and we are committed to engaging in \\nindustry-level interventions in order to drive improvement \\nin working conditions. We are dedicated to working with \\nour suppliers to understand root causes and build strong \\nmanagement systems to address and mitigate issues. \\n\\nLearn more about our supplier assessments \\n\\n.\\n\\nSupplier Assessments\\n\\nWe assess our suppliers of Amazon-branded products \\nacross four main categories: 1) Labor, 2) Health and Safety, \\n3) Environment, and 4) Ethics. These categories are divided \\ninto subcategories, such as nondiscrimination, emergency \\npreparedness, hazardous substances, and transparency. \\nFindings within each subcategory are flagged as High, \\nMedium, or Low depending on the level of severity. Amazon \\nfocuses on setting a high bar for new suppliers and refusing \\nto go to production until suppliers remediate High-level \\nfindings identified in our assessments. We recognize that \\nsome issues may take time to effectively remediate. For \\nMedium-level issues, we expect suppliers to show they \\nare making meaningful progress toward remediation \\nwithin a defined timeline. For Low-level issues, we monitor \\nsuppliers for continual improvement. We have dedicated \\nteams based in key sourcing countries around the globe \\nthat work directly with our suppliers to identify solutions to \\nchallenging problems and promote open dialogue. We seek \\nto create long-term relationships with suppliers that align \\nwith our values and are committed to constantly improving \\nconditions. Where we see trends in issues beyond individual \\nsuppliers, such as widespread health and safety deficits or \\nindustrywide failures to responsibly protect migrant workers, \\nwe work to define regional or global strategies to address \\nunderlying systemic challenges. \\n\\n data (see Appendix) \\n\\nWe share our supplier assessment \\nto demonstrate our commitment to transparency and \\ncontribute to industrywide knowledge on complex and \\nchanging supply chain conditions. In 2021, we conducted \\n5,952 assessments to help us determine which suppliers \\nto work with and, for those we do engage, to help us \\nunderstand and continually improve those suppliers’ \\npractices. We utilize three types of assessments: \\n\\n•   Pre-Production Assessments: Suppliers must submit \\n\\nan Amazon-approved assessment of their facilities \\nbefore beginning production of Amazon-branded \\nproducts (28% of assessments conducted in 2021 \\nwere Pre-Production Assessments). \\n\\n•   Ongoing Assessments: Suppliers must submit Amazon-\\n\\napproved assessments on an ongoing basis while producing \\nAmazon products (51% of assessments conducted in 2021 \\nwere Ongoing Assessments). \\n\\n•   Verification Assessments: Where issues are identified, \\nsuppliers must develop a corrective action plan detailing \\nactions to address identified issues and a long-term \\nplan to prevent reoccurrence, and where necessary, \\nmust undergo a follow-up assessment to remediate \\nissues (21% of assessments conducted in 2021 were \\nVerification Assessments).\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n69  \\n\\nOur Approach \\n\\nWorking alongside community partners, we create solutions \\nto some of the world’s most pressing challenges and build \\nlong-term programs that have a lasting, positive impact. \\nWe work to address immediate needs, such as reducing \\nhunger and homelessness, providing affordable housing, and \\nserving communities in need following natural disasters. We \\nalso look to the future, by providing programs that support \\nscience, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education \\nand skills training.\\n\\nAccess to Food and Basic Needs\\n\\nWe help address urgent issues faced by children and families \\nfrom underserved communities by improving access to food \\nand basic necessities. We leverage our logistics network \\nto support food banks and community organizations, \\ndelivering groceries and pre-packaged meals directly to \\nvulnerable families. \\n\\nWe also work to eliminate barriers to learning by providing \\nstudents with clothing, hygiene products, and other \\nsupplies that help them focus on their studies. We donate \\nto nonprofits supporting school districts in Washington \\nstate’s Puget Sound region, Northern Virginia, and Nashville, \\nTennessee.

This outreach is complementary to the hundreds \\nof touchpoints our Investor Relations team has with \\nshareholders each year. We find it beneficial to have ongoing \\ndialogue with our shareholders throughout the year on a full \\nrange of investor priorities. Depending on the circumstance, \\nour lead director or another independent director may \\nengage in these conversations with shareholders as well. \\n\\nIn 2021, as part of our corporate governance engagement, \\nwe met with corporate governance representatives at \\nshareholders owning over 35% of our stock (not counting \\nthe approximately 13% voted by our founder and Executive \\nChair) and responded to numerous letters from our investors. \\nOur direct engagement with shareholders helps us better \\nunderstand our shareholders’ priorities, perspectives, and \\nissues of concern while giving us an opportunity to elaborate \\non our many initiatives and practices and to address the \\nextent to which various aspects of these matters are (or \\nare not) significant given the scope and nature of our \\noperations and our existing practices.

We are \\ndeploying zero-emission vehicles, using low-carbon fuels, investing in emerging technologies, and collaborating with others to accelerate cross-sector innovation. \\n\\nResource Efficiency; Energy Source\\n\\nIn 2019, we ordered 100,000 custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian and thousands more from global manufacturers such as Stellantis and Mahindra Electric. In 2021, more than 100 million packages were delivered to customers’ \\ndoorsteps across Europe with a fleet of over 3,000 electric delivery vans and other zero-emission vehicles. Also in 2021, more than half a million packages were delivered to customers’ doorsteps in North America with electric vehicles (EVs).\\n\\nWe also started deploying battery EV trucks across our heavy commercial trucking fleets and began switching to vehicles that use alternative fuel sources, like compressed natural gas trucks. Micromobility technologies, such as cargo bikes \\nand walkers, are used to deliver packages in urban settings. In 2021, we helped launch Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels and became a founding private sector member of the First Movers Coalition to lead decarbonization of the \\nmaritime shipping industry. \\n\\nRead more about how we are decarbonizing our transportation network \\n\\n on pages 24–25.\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n94  \\n\\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nWaste and Recycling\\nAmazon is working to send less material to landfills and more back into the circular economy loop by developing waste-prevention and -reuse programs within our own operations and for our customers. Through Amazon Second Chance, \\nwe offer customers access to a range of services to recycle, repair, or trade in their items, as well as shop for like-new and refurbished products. At our global fulfillment centers, we use software to identify and sort eligible items that are fit \\nfor donation. We partner with local community organizations to collect these items from Amazon facilities and distribute them to people in need. Since 2019, Amazon has contributed more than 100 million products to our global charity \\npartners in North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan.\\n\\nWe work with third-party recycling haulers to remove excess corrugated board from our facilities for off-site recycling. Many of these haulers also supply Amazon with the packaging materials that we use for customer shipments, \\nconverting waste material recovered from Amazon operations into new, recycled packaging. For plastic film, which is not commonly accepted through municipal recycling programs, we have developed on-site recycling systems that enable \\nus to convert plastic film into bags made of 100% recycled material.\\n\\nWe incorporate recycled plastics, fabrics, and metals into many new Amazon devices, giving new life to materials that could have otherwise ended up in waste streams. In 2021, we launched several Echo, Fire TV, Fire Tablet, Kindle, and \\nSmart Home devices and accessories that include up to 60% recycled molded plastic, up to 100% recycled fabrics, up to 100% recycled aluminum, and up to 70% recycled magnesium, depending on the product. \\n\\nRead more about how we are reducing waste and improving recycling \\n\\n on pages 26–27.\\n\\nClassification\\n\\nResource Efficiency; Products \\nand Services\\n\\nPackaging\\nWe work to reinvent and simplify our sustainable packaging options using a science-based approach that combines lab testing, machine learning, materials science, and manufacturing partnerships to scale sustainable change across the \\npackaging supply chain.

This includes both our Amazon-branded products and the third-party items we offer that feature \\nsustainability certifications through our Climate Pledge Friendly program. Since we launched Climate Pledge Friendly in 2020, the number of products included in the program has grown from 75,000 to more than 250,000. In 2021, more \\nthan 370 million Climate Pledge Friendly units were shipped to Amazon customers, and we welcomed 20 new third-party sustainability certifications to the program. In early 2022, we launched Amazon Aware, a new line of everyday \\nessential items, all with third-party certifications featured in our Climate Pledge Friendly program. \\n\\nResource Efficiency; Products \\nand Services\\n\\nIn addition to offering more-sustainable choices, we want our Amazon Private Brands to support responsible supply chains and contribute to growing circular economies. We are working to enhance the certification and traceability of key \\nraw materials and ingredients in our consumable products. We participate in industry partnerships and working groups that drive greater adoption of sustainable and responsible practices.

We focus on \\nefficiency across all aspects of our infrastructure, from the design of our data centers and hardware to modeling the performance of our operations for continual efficiency enhancements. We also offer a customer carbon footprint tool that \\nuses simple visualizations to show customers their historical carbon emissions, evaluate related trends as their use of AWS evolves, estimate emissions avoided through AWS compared with on-premises data centers, and review forecasted \\nemissions based on their current use.\\n\\nRead more about AWS \\n\\n on pages 35–38.\\n\\nClassification\\n\\nResource Efficiency; Products \\nand Services\\n\\nWater Stewardship\\nOur holistic approach to water stewardship minimizes both energy and water consumption in our data center operations and guides our water use strategy for each AWS Region. This starts with evaluating climate patterns, local water \\nmanagement and availability, and opportunities to avoid using potable water sources whenever possible.

For a company of \\nthe size and broad scope of Amazon, it’s a big challenge. \\nBut at Amazon, we don’t shy away from big challenges. \\nWe innovate and create. We don’t have all the answers \\ntoday, but we believe in the need to act now.\\n\\nThis is reflected in one of our newest Leadership Principles, \\nintroduced last year: Success and Scale Bring Broad \\nResponsibility. It says that “we are big, we impact the world, \\nand we are far from perfect. We must be humble and \\nthoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. \\nOur local communities, planet, and future generations \\nneed us to be better every day.” We apply our Leadership \\nPrinciples daily—whether we are discussing ideas for new \\ninventions or deciding on the best approach to solve a \\nproblem. Throughout 2021, we embedded the spirit of \\nthis Leadership Principle into our everyday actions and \\ncontinued to make progress on our environmental and \\nsocial commitments.\\n\\nDelivering Progress for the Planet \\n\\nIn 2019, we co-founded The Climate Pledge and made a \\ncommitment to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years \\nahead of the Paris Agreement. We invited others to join \\nus and there are now more than 300 businesses and \\norganizations across 51 industries and 29 countries that \\nhave signed the Pledge, which means we are collectively \\ncoming at the climate crisis from nearly every sector and \\nnearly every angle. \\n\\ndiverse representation in our workforce at the most senior \\nlevels. We’ve helped more than 70,000 Amazon employees \\nlearn new skills and advance their careers as part of our \\nUpskilling 2025 pledge, and we are enabling thousands of \\nhourly employees in 14 countries to earn certificates and \\ndegrees through Amazon Career Choice. Earlier this year, we \\nalso expanded travel reimbursements for our employees in \\nthe U.S. to cover treatment for non-life-threatening medical \\nissues when travel is required, including elective abortion and \\ninfertility, starting in 2022.\\n\\nAs part of our efforts to decarbonize our business, we \\nbecame the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable \\nenergy in 2020, and last year, we reached 85% renewable \\nenergy across our business. We continue to expand our use \\nof zero-emission transportation such as electric delivery \\nvans, cargo bikes, and on-foot deliveries, and in 2021, more \\nthan 100 million packages were delivered to our customers’ \\ndoorsteps globally using zero-emission vehicles. We are also \\ninvesting in nature-based solutions, and last year, we helped \\nto create the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest \\nfinance (LEAF) Coalition—a global initiative of governments \\nand leading companies that has already mobilized $1 billion \\nto protect the world’s tropical rainforests. We will continue \\nto act boldly to address climate change and to invest in \\nsolutions to help meet our commitment to reach net-zero \\ncarbon across our operations by 2040.\\n\\nDelivering Progress for People \\n\\nOur ability to be a force for change on behalf of our planet \\nrelies on diverse perspectives from smart, passionate, \\nand committed people from all backgrounds. In 2021, we \\ncontinued to make progress on our diversity goals, including \\nincreasing the number of Black directors and vice presidents \\nby almost 70%, and we remain committed to increasing \\n\\nIn our communities, we are supporting initiatives to address \\nthe affordable housing crisis—including a commitment of \\nmore than $2 billion from the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, \\nlaunched last year. As of March 2022, these commitments \\nhave already preserved or created 8,000 affordable units to \\nhouse more than 18,000 people. Also last year—in service \\nto people in our communities and supply chain—we signed \\nthe United Nations’ (UN) Women’s Empowerment Principles, \\nwhich offers businesses guidance on ways to promote \\ngender equity in the workplace and global community; we \\ncreated a $150 million Black Business Accelerator program \\nin partnership with our Black Employee Network affinity \\ngroup; and we launched a $12 million, five-year partnership \\nwith the U.S. National Safety Council to uncover new ways \\nto prevent and address musculoskeletal disorders.\\n\\nSince the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early \\n2022, we quickly mobilized to provide humanitarian aid and \\nassistance to the people of Ukraine, including financial and \\nin-kind donations, cloud computing credits, resettlement \\nsupport, and more. We are proud of how our global teams \\ncame together to support this effort and are honored \\nto have been awarded the Ukraine Peace Prize for the \\nsupport AWS has shown the Ukraine government and the \\nUkrainian people.\\n\\nDelivering Progress Every Day \\n\\nWe are proud of the progress we’ve made, but we \\nrecognize we have more to do. Our everyday actions to \\ndeliver progress are in service of achieving long-term, \\nsystemic change that improves the well-being of people, \\ncommunities, and the planet.\\n\\nThe path to achieving some of our goals will be long and \\ncomplex, but we are not deterred. At Amazon, we thrive on \\npushing the boundaries of what’s possible. We are taking \\nthe same tenacity we use to invent and problem solve for \\nour customers and applying it to how we help address some \\nof the world’s biggest challenges. I hope you enjoy learning \\nmore about how we are doing this as you read our 2021 \\nSustainability Report. \\n\\nWith gratitude, \\n\\nKara Hurst\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n4  \\n\\nOur Business\\n\\nAs part of our mission to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, we are \\ncommitted to building a sustainable business for our employees, customers, \\nand communities, including the people that support our entire value chain. \\n\\nOur Operations \\n\\nOur Communities\\n\\nOur Supply Chain\\n\\nOur Customers \\n\\nWe offer access to a wide selection of products \\nsold by us and by third parties across dozens of \\ncategories.

At the height of the pandemic, our \\nlabs were processing more than 30,000 tests each day.\\n\\nWe took what we learned from this process to create our \\nown at-home COVID-19 test collection kit \\n for customers. \\nThe tests received Emergency Use Authorization from the \\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration in June 2021, providing \\nan affordable, reliable, and convenient way for customers \\nto test for COVID-19 at home. The kits are processed by \\nAmazon’s in-house laboratory using the diagnostic approach \\nrecommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  \\nand Prevention \\n\\n. \\n\\nOur infrastructure has also been helping scientists gain and \\nshare knowledge of RNA viruses in record time. Diseases \\ncaused by RNA viruses include the common cold, influenza, \\nSARS, COVID-19, hepatitis C, Ebola, rabies, polio, and measles.\\n\\nAn international team of scientists from the Serratus project \\nbuilt a powerful supercomputer on AWS \\n in just eight weeks. \\nThe supercomputer searched almost 6 million publicly available \\nbiological samples for the presence of RNA viruses in less than \\ntwo weeks for $24,000—achieving what would have taken a \\nstandard computer well over 2,000 years and cost at least 10 \\ntimes more.

That’s why we \\nco-founded The Climate Pledge, \\na commitment to reach net-zero \\ncarbon by 2040—10 years ahead \\nof the Paris Agreement. Since we \\ncreated the Pledge in 2019, more \\nthan 300 companies have joined \\nAmazon in making this commitment.\\n\\nThe path to decarbonization remains challenging. This \\nis especially true for a business of the size and broad \\nscope of Amazon. We operate businesses—delivery \\nand transportation logistics, physical stores, grocery, \\nmanufacturing, and cloud computing services—that involve \\nmoving products, manufacturing goods, and creating \\ncomputing capacity, all at scale. While some of these \\nbusinesses—including cloud computing and e-commerce—\\noffer greater efficiencies, some are more carbon-intensive \\nendeavors. In reducing their carbon footprint through \\ninvestment and innovation, we will enable even greater \\nefficiency and more-sustainable choices for our customers. \\n\\nAs we work to decarbonize our company, Amazon is growing \\nrapidly. We have scaled our business at an unprecedented \\npace to help meet the needs of our customers through the \\npandemic. From early 2020 to the end of 2021, we created \\nmore than 750,000 full-time and part-time jobs worldwide \\nand doubled the size of the fulfillment network that we \\nhad built over the previous 25 years. At the same time, an \\nincreasing number of companies around the world moved \\ntheir technology to the cloud, gaining significant speed, \\ninnovation, and cost advantages, and AWS grew its revenue by \\n37% year-over-year in 2021. \\n\\nThese developments meant we had to build new facilities—\\nfor both our consumer and cloud businesses—and expand \\nour transportation network. Throughout this growth, we \\nremained focused on improving our efficiency through \\nmore-sustainable solutions, including electric vehicles and \\nalternative fuel options as well as wind and solar power \\nacross our network. In AWS, the team spent considerable \\nresource innovating on power efficiency, removing the \\ncentral Uninterruptible Power Supply from our data center \\n\\ndesign, integrating power supplies into our racks, and \\nutilizing Graviton EC2 instances that use up to 60% less \\nenergy for the same performance than comparable Amazon \\nEC2 instances. \\n\\nWith all of our growth in 2021, our absolute carbon \\nemissions increased by 18% in 2021; however, importantly, \\nour carbon intensity decreased by 1.9%—this is the third \\nyear in a row we’ve seen our carbon intensity decrease. \\nThis measurement quantifies total carbon emissions, in \\ngrams of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e), per dollar of \\ngross merchandise sales (GMS). As companies invest in \\nnew products and services, and their businesses grow \\nsubstantially, the focus should not be solely on a company’s \\ncarbon footprint in terms of absolute carbon emissions, but \\nalso on whether it’s lowering its carbon intensity. Over time, \\ncontinued decreases in carbon intensity can lead to lower \\nabsolute emissions. See the Appendix \\n\\n for our carbon data.\\n\\nWhile we’ve had success cutting emissions from some \\noperations, we are still early in the process of transforming \\nothers. Some actions and investments have immediate \\ncarbon savings, while others will take years to demonstrate \\nresults. The path to net-zero carbon has many obstacles, \\nbut we thrive on big challenges. A few of those big \\nchallenges include: \\n\\n•  Powering our operations with 100% renewable energy  \\n\\nby 2025 \\n\\n•  Developing more-sustainable transportation infrastructure \\n•  Constructing more-sustainable buildings\\n•  Decarbonizing the supply chain \\n\\nPowering Operations With 100% \\nRenewable Energy\\n\\nIn 2021, we reached 85% renewable energy across our \\noperations, and we are on a path to achieve 100% by \\n2025—five years ahead of the original target of 2030. \\nThis transition to 100% renewable energy benefits our \\ncustomers as well. Studies by the international analyst firm \\n451 Research found that moving on-premises computing \\nworkloads to AWS can lower workload carbon footprint by \\nnearly 80% compared to surveyed enterprise data centers. \\nThat number could improve to as high as 96% once AWS is \\npowered with 100% renewable energy—a target we are on \\npath to meet by 2025. AWS’ infrastructure is 3.6 times more \\nenergy efficient than the median of surveyed U.S. enterprise \\ndata centers and up to five times more energy efficient than \\nthe average European enterprise data center. \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n11  \\n\\ntechnologies: Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund—a corporate \\nventure fund that invests in sustainability—recently \\nannounced it has invested in EH2 in the U.S. and Sunfire \\nin Germany, two companies helping to push the green \\nhydrogen industry forward.\\n\\nrenewable energy through a combination of off-site and  \\non-site solar projects. And we plan to achieve Leadership \\nin Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum \\ncertification, the highest sustainability building certification \\nissued by the U.S. Green Building Council. \\n\\nIt will take time to remove carbon emissions from heavy \\ntransportation systems, including ocean shipping, aviation, \\nand trucking. Governments and the private sector need \\nto come together on this important work. Amazon is at \\nthe heart of such industry initiatives and government \\npartnerships, including the Cargo Owners for Zero Emission \\nVessels network (coZEV), the First Movers Coalition, the \\nSustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance Aviators Group (SABA), \\nand the Clean Energy Demand Initiative. \\n\\nWe also continue to innovate with construction techniques to \\nmake our fulfillment centers more sustainable. Many of our \\nfulfillment facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India \\nare powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation \\ncan power up to 80% of the facility’s energy use. As of  \\n2021, 115 of our global fulfillment facilities have rooftop \\nsolar installations.\\n\\nConstructing our AWS data centers also presents challenges \\nrelated to sustainability. Concrete and steel used in \\nconstruction are two of the largest contributors of  \\nembodied carbon in a data center building, and we have \\nmultiple initiatives to reduce their carbon impact. For \\nexample, our design standards now require concrete with a \\n20% reduction in embodied carbon compared with standard \\nconcrete for new U.S. data centers, and we are expanding \\nthis requirement globally. Also, instead of using steel from \\noxygen furnaces that burn coal or gas, we are moving to \\nsteel from electric-arc furnaces, which use scrap steel and \\ncan create steel using renewable energy and up to 100% \\nrecycled content. In 2021, six AWS data centers were \\nconstructed with steel made this way, and we have plans  \\nto build more in the future.\\n\\nDeveloping More-Sustainable \\nTransportation Infrastructure \\n\\nConstructing More-\\nSustainable Buildings \\n\\nReducing carbon emissions in transportation is a complex \\nchallenge for many companies. We plan to make half of \\nour shipments net-zero carbon by 2030, and to do that, we \\nare creating a worldwide fleet of zero-emission vehicles. \\nRight now, the vehicles and charging infrastructure don’t \\nexist at the scale needed to serve customers. We need \\nthe supply to increase dramatically. We have ordered \\n100,000 electric vehicles (EVs) from Rivian, and thousands \\nmore from manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, \\nStellantis, and Mahindra Electric. These orders have sent a \\ndemand signal that is shifting the market to meet not only \\nour needs, but also the needs of other companies around \\nthe world. \\n\\nBusinesses also face the challenge of removing carbon \\nemissions from new building construction. Via The \\nClimate Pledge Fund, Amazon has invested in CarbonCure \\nTechnologies, which enables concrete producers to make the \\nsame high-quality concrete with a lower carbon footprint, \\nand Brimstone Energy, which seeks to make cement carbon-\\nneutral through a process focused on calcium silicate rocks, \\nwhich have no embedded CO2, as well as magnesium \\nspecies, which passively absorb CO2. Amazon is lowering \\nthe carbon footprint of our buildings by using CarbonCure’s \\nsystems and Brimstone Energy cement in some new \\nconstruction, including in Amazon’s second headquarters in \\nVirginia (HQ2). \\n\\nWe announced in November that, in the city of Paris, \\ntwo-thirds of our shipments are delivered using zero-\\nemission transport such as EVs, electric cargo bikes, and \\non-foot deliveries. We also are exploring green hydrogen \\n\\nHQ2 will be a model for sustainable construction. We’ve \\nelectrified the operations of HQ2, eliminating the use of \\nfossil fuels for buildings systems and food service. We have \\ncommitted to powering 100% of HQ2’s operations with \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n12  \\n\\nDecarbonizing the Supply Chain\\n\\nWe Thrive on Big Challenges\\n\\nAmazon utilizes an extensive supply chain to deliver goods \\nand services to our customers. Our carbon accounting \\nprocess addresses all three Scopes of emissions under the \\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol. Since 2019, we have shared the \\nScope 1, 2, and 3 emissions included in our footprint through \\nour annual Sustainability Report, along with a detailed \\ndescription of the comprehensive methodology underlying \\nour calculations. \\n\\nMeasurement is critical as we work toward our goal of net-\\nzero carbon by 2040—we have to measure and understand \\nemissions in order to eliminate them. Like other companies, \\nwe are working to improve the granularity of data available \\nand will continue to seek improvements to our reporting \\nprocesses. We already work with organizations and \\nregulatory bodies around the globe to promote transparent \\nand comparable climate reporting.\\n\\nOne example of this is through our partnership with the \\nWe Mean Business Coalition, a group of nonprofits focused \\non accelerating the transition to a net-zero economy. We \\nsupport the Coalition’s SME Climate Hub—a global initiative \\nthat gives small and medium-sized enterprises, like those \\nin our supply chain, free tools and resources to measure \\nand report their emissions. With the Hub’s support, these \\ncompanies are committing to halve their emissions by 2030 \\nand to reach net-zero by 2050. \\n\\nThe challenges we collectively face on the path to net-zero \\ncarbon are considerable. Many new technologies are  \\nshowing promise in their ability to reduce carbon emissions, \\nbut may still require significant development. We need to \\nboth invent new solutions and scale and drive down the \\ncosts of known solutions. \\n\\nIn 2021, we reached 85% renewable energy across our \\noperations, and we are on a path to achieve 100% by \\n2025—five years ahead of the original target of 2030. \\nProgress is not easy, and we are far from done. However, \\nour success in deploying renewable energy globally provides \\nus with a playbook that we are deploying to tackle big \\nchallenges like transportation, building construction, and \\nsupply chain decarbonization strategies. With our relentless \\nculture of innovation, and a tenacious team of sustainability \\nscientists and professionals, we are committed to reaching \\nour 2040 target. \\n\\nBut we can’t do it alone. We will continue to work with \\npartners in the public and private sectors to drive innovation, \\ntechnology advancements, and global policy change. To the \\npublic sector, we say: We support and encourage policies \\nand public-private partnerships that will help accelerate \\nclimate solutions. And as one of more than 300 signatories \\nto The Climate Pledge, we say to the innovators, scientists, \\nbuilders, and entrepreneurs: Our door is open. We all need to \\ndecarbonize.

We \\nbelieve that companies, including \\nAmazon, can drastically reduce \\ntheir own emissions while also \\ninvesting outside their operations \\nin initiatives that significantly \\ncontribute to achieving the Paris \\nAgreement. One way we are doing \\nthis is by investing in nature-based \\nsolutions that conserve, restore, and \\nimprove land management activities \\nto increase carbon storage in a \\nvariety of habitats.\\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\nIn 2019, Amazon created the Right Now Climate Fund, a \\n$100 million fund for nature-based solutions to restore and \\nconserve forests, wetlands, and grasslands around the world. \\n\\nAmazon uses nature-based solutions to mitigate carbon \\nemissions outside of our value chain and supplement the \\ncarbon-reduction efforts we are driving across our operations. \\nNature-based solutions also have the additional benefit of \\nhelping to preserve the natural world by conserving wildlife \\nhabitats, protecting biodiversity, improving water quality, and \\nreducing flood risk. All of these impacts can greatly enhance \\nwell-being in communities around the world.\\n\\nWe follow scientific research to fund initiatives that are critical \\nto hitting the targets of the Paris Agreement and staving \\noff the most catastrophic effects of climate change. Our \\napproach to carbon neutralization focuses on three actions \\noutside our value chain that can deliver needed mitigation \\nand that have a significant unmet need for investment: \\n\\n•  Reducing deforestation to near zero, especially in \\n\\ntropical regions\\n\\n•  Scaling up the removal of carbon from the atmosphere \\n\\nwith nature-based solutions such as reforestation \\nand agroforestry\\n\\n•  Scaling up carbon-removal technologies, such as direct \\n\\nair carbon capture and storage\\n\\nScaling Up Nature-Based \\nCarbon Removal\\n\\nNature-based carbon removal has the potential to take \\nbillions of tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. \\nOur nature-based carbon removal actions center on \\ndeveloping systems, tools, scientific knowledge, and \\n\\n2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n18  \\n\\nscalable business models for reforestation and regenerative \\nagroforestry.

Through \\ncoZEV, Amazon is supporting initiatives to increase the \\navailability of zero-emission technologies and fuels while \\ngaining support from shipping lines, cargo owners, ports, and \\nother organizations that can enable energy transition. We \\nalso became a founding private sector member of the First \\nMovers Coalition to lead decarbonization of the maritime \\nshipping industry. The coalition brings global companies \\ntogether to harness their purchasing power and supply \\nchains to create early markets for innovative clean energy \\ntechnologies that are key for tackling the climate crisis. With \\nthis launch, we announced our commitment to use ships with \\nzero-emission fuels for at least 10% of the volume of our \\ngoods shipped internationally by 2030 and 100% by 2040. \\n\\nAdditionally, we are driving policies that support the adoption \\nof green technology around the world. In May 2021, we \\nsupported a policy proposal to the Japanese government for \\nthe adoption of zero-emission vehicles in the delivery industry \\nby the Japan Climate Leaders’ Partnership \\n. The government \\nset a new target of 100% electric or fuel cell vehicles in new \\ndelivery vehicle sales by 2040.

By donating surplus inventory to charitable \\norganizations, we keep usable products out of the waste \\nstream and help strengthen our local communities.\\n\\nMany of our product donations are generated through our \\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) donations program, which \\nautomates the process for Amazon selling partners to donate \\ntheir overstocked or returned items. The service requires no \\nadditional action from selling partners, allowing Amazon to \\neasily scale product donations through our existing logistics. \\n\\nWe distribute the majority of our product donations through \\nGood360, a nonprofit that works with a network of 100,000 \\ncharity partners in the U.S. Through our partnership with \\nGood360, Amazon product donations are distributed to low-\\nincome households, foster families, individuals with special \\nneeds or disabilities, seniors, veterans, immigrants, and more. \\nIn Europe, we partner directly with more than 100 charities \\nand local organizations to distribute product donations. \\n\\nSince 2019, Amazon has contributed more than 100 million \\nproducts to our global charity partners in North America, \\nEurope, Australia, and Japan. We are continuing to expand \\nour product donations program globally by adding new \\nlocations in the Middle East, North Africa, and South America.\\n\\nRedirecting Food Waste\\n\\nAs an online food retailer and an operator of physical grocery \\nstores, Amazon is committed to reducing our food waste \\n\\nCityServe\\n\\nCityServe, based in California, is one example \\nof a Good360 Community Redistribution \\nPartner; it works with a network of local \\nchurches to deliver necessities to thousands \\nof individuals and families.\\n\\nIn 2021, our donations enabled CityServe \\nto provide personal care supplies to more \\nthan 20,000 people. CityServe staff and \\nvolunteers assembled “blessing bags” full \\nof items donated by Amazon, including \\ntoothpaste, toothbrushes, hand towels, and \\ndisposable masks. The bags were distributed \\nto individuals and families without housing. \\n\\nby 50% across our U.S. and Europe operations by 2030. \\nWe became a member of the Food Loss and Waste 2030 \\nChampions \\n through the U.S. Environmental Protection \\nAgency in 2020, and extended our commitment to reducing \\nfood waste to our Europe operations in 2021. To achieve \\nthis, we are optimizing our food inventory management \\nsystems to minimize waste from the outset and prioritizing \\nways to avoid landfills.\\n\\nWherever possible, we donate surplus food to individuals and \\nfamilies who need it most through community redistribution \\nprograms. In 2021, we donated 85 million pounds of \\nfood—equivalent to more than 70 million meals—through \\nFeeding America in the U.S. Feeding America is a network \\nof food banks, pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other \\ncommunity-based agencies that helps Amazon maximize the \\nimpact of our food donations. In Europe, we donated more \\nthan 4,000 tons of food—equivalent to 10 million meals—in \\n\\n2021. All of our UK grocery stores have a donation  \\npartner in place that helps deliver surplus food to charities \\naround London. Similarly, all of our U.S. grocery stores have \\na donation partner. \\n\\nFor food that can’t be donated, we turn to processes \\nthat avoid landfills, such as composting and anaerobic \\ndigestion. In 2021, we diverted 27,000 tons of food through \\ncomposting and anaerobic digestion across our worldwide \\noperations. All Amazon Fresh stores operating in the U.S. \\nhave composting programs for food that cannot be donated, \\nand we are expanding our on-site composting capabilities \\nacross our facilities.\\n\\nAt our Whole Foods Market stores, we have active \\ncomposting programs at nearly 470 locations and collectively \\ndiverted more than 155,000 tons of food waste by the \\nend of 2021. Another 2,775 tons of food waste were sent \\n\\nto anaerobic digestion facilities through an organic waste \\nrecycling system called Grind2Energy. The Grind2Energy \\nsystem has helped to divert 12,500 tons of food waste at \\nWhole Foods Market stores since 2014. As a result, we have \\nprevented nearly 9,000 metric tons of CO2e from entering \\nthe atmosphere and produced enough clean, renewable \\nenergy to power over 2,500 U.S. homes for a month. \\n\\nRecycling Solutions Across \\nOur Operations\\n\\nCorrugated board is the most common material that \\nflows through our fulfillment center operations, and we \\nwork with third-party recycling haulers to remove excess \\ncorrugate from our facilities for off-site recycling. Many \\nof these haulers also supply Amazon with the packaging \\nmaterials that we use for customer shipments, converting \\nwaste material recovered from Amazon operations into \\nnew, recycled packaging.\\n\\nNot all the materials we use can be easily recycled with \\ncurrent systems, so we look for innovative solutions to \\nrecycle these challenging materials. One example is plastic \\nfilm, which is not commonly accepted through municipal \\nrecycling programs. We have on-site plastic film recycling \\nsystems at many Amazon operations facilities across North \\nAmerica and Europe, enabling us to convert plastic film into \\nbags made of 100% recycled material.\\n\\nWe continue to explore alternative solutions for other \\nmaterials that are challenging to recycle. In 2021, we \\ncompleted a pilot to recycle and repair damaged bags used to \\nsort and stow items in our fulfillment operations into reusable \\nmaterials. Additionally, we work with our shipping label \\nsuppliers in several European locations to recycle the silicone \\nbacking paper from shipping labels to make new ones. \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Improving Our \\nPackaging \\n\\nPackaging plays a critical role in \\nthe customer delivery experience, \\nand Amazon is committed to \\ndelivering products safely and \\nsustainably. Since 2015, we have \\ninvested in materials, processes, \\nand technologies that have reduced \\nper-shipment packaging weight \\nby 38% and eliminated over \\n1.5 million tons of packaging.\\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\nAmazon customers want right-sized, recyclable packaging \\nthat minimizes waste and ensures damage-free delivery. \\nWe work to reinvent and simplify our sustainable packaging \\noptions using a science-based approach that combines \\nlab testing, machine learning, materials science, and \\nmanufacturing partnerships to scale sustainable change \\nacross the packaging supply chain.\\n\\nEliminating Packaging Where Possible\\n\\nFrustration-Free Packaging (FFP) \\n is Amazon’s flagship \\nprogram designed to reinvent the packaging experience. \\nFFP products offer more-sustainable packaging that is \\neasy to open, fully recyclable, and capable of shipping \\nwithout additional packaging protection. In 2021, we began \\noffering incentives to vendors that convert their packaging \\nto FFP to encourage more vendors to adopt these best-in-\\nclass standards. We also offer additional incentives when \\nthose changes include reductions in total cubic volume. \\nThis generates less packaging waste for customers and \\nenables more packages per delivery vehicle. By the end \\nof 2021, more than 2 million products qualified under \\nour FFP programs. \\n\\n2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n28  \\n\\nPartnering for Better Packaging\\n\\nSome products are more difficult to ship than others. \\nStemware, for example, is fragile and frequently arrives \\nwith multiple layers of padding to prevent damage. This \\nadditional material can make for a frustrating customer \\nexperience and doesn’t always protect the product.\\n\\nTo demonstrate that e-commerce packaging can be \\nboth minimal and effective, we facilitated a complete \\nredesign of stemware packaging for Lenox, a well-\\nknown brand that has specialized in tableware and \\nglassware for over 130 years. \\n\\nThis novel packaging design includes changing product \\norientation to optimize for space. It also includes a \\nprotective corrugate insert, replacing the need for \\nbubble wrap, further reducing plastic waste and \\nimproving the customer experience. The result is a fully \\nrecyclable package that uses 83% less material weight \\nand 78% less volume without compromising protection \\nof the item inside.\\n\\nCold Groceries, Delivered \\nMore Sustainably \\n\\nIn 2021, U.S. grocery teams launched new curbside-\\nrecyclable packaging to replace nonrecyclable insulation \\nthat protects chilled items in grocery deliveries. This has \\neliminated the annual need for 1,500 tons of natural \\ncotton fiber and 7,500 tons of nonrecyclable mixed \\nplastic that was previously required to safely deliver \\nchilled or frozen groceries from Amazon Fresh and \\nWhole Foods Market.\\n\\nIt is particularly challenging to design new solutions \\nthat maintain adequate insulation properties to keep \\nproducts chilled. Our innovative packaging uses layers \\nof  tissue to provide both durability and insulation \\nwithout sacrificing recyclability. \\n\\nCustomers were with us for every step of this journey.\\n\\nLearn more about how we tested this packaging in \\nseveral U.S. cities and incorporated improvements into \\nthe design based on customer feedback \\n\\n.\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n29  \\n\\nOptimizing Materials Where \\nPackaging Is Necessary\\n\\nWhen additional Amazon packaging is required to ship a \\nproduct, we strive to optimize that packaging for increased \\nrecyclability along with reduced waste and carbon. We are \\ntransitioning to materials that are compatible with local \\npaper and plastic recycling streams where we operate. We \\nalso support initiatives to expand the availability of curbside \\nrecycling infrastructure to the public through investments in The \\nRecycling Partnership and the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund. \\n\\nIn the U.S., we expanded the use of our recyclable paper \\npadded mailer, replacing nearly 70% of our mixed material \\nbubble mailers in 2021. We also improved the composition \\nof our single-use plastic packaging to use less material and \\nincorporate more recycled content. In 2021, we increased the \\nrecycled content of our plastic film bags from 25% to 50% \\nand that of our plastic padded bags from 15% to over 40%. \\nThrough these collective efforts, we avoided over 30,000 tons \\nof plastic across North America in 2021.\\n\\nIn Europe, we switched from single-use plastic delivery bags \\nto recyclable paper delivery bags and cardboard envelopes \\nfor orders shipped from fulfillment centers in 2021. We also \\nremoved a wide range of single-use plastic products from \\nour European stores. In Australia, we replaced all single-use \\nair pillows with 100% recyclable paper material to protect \\ngoods during shipping. Amazon also became a founding \\nmember of the India Plastics Pact after removing single-use, \\nthin film plastics from Amazon packaging throughout India \\nfulfillment centers in 2020. \\n\\nUsing Technology to Optimize \\nPackaging Type and Fit\\n\\nWe use a range of boxes and mailers across our fulfillment \\nnetwork, and for every shipment that requires packaging, we \\nuse science-based systems to determine optimal packaging \\nsizes and types. This starts with using machine learning \\nto identify products that can be delivered safely with less \\nmaterial. Machine learning algorithms help us determine \\n\\nwhen smaller products are suitable for flexible packaging, \\nsuch as padded mailers and bags, which are up to 75% \\nlighter than similar-sized boxes. Over the past five years, \\nthese algorithms have allowed us to reduce the use of \\ncorrugated boxes by over 35%.\\n\\nIn 2021, we deployed data-science algorithms to optimize \\nthe number and size of boxes used for 12 geographies \\naround the world. These algorithms—which help our \\nfulfillment centers maintain the right mix of box sizes— \\nnow cover 65% of global box shipments, with plans to  \\nscale to 97% in 2022.\\n\\nWe also introduced advanced fitting algorithms designed \\nto reduce packaging specifically for shipments with \\nmultiple items. These new algorithms calculate the \\npossible arrangements of products for best fit in a three-\\ndimensional virtual package.

They inform, \\nentertain, and connect our customers, and we are working \\nhard to make our devices more sustainable. That includes \\nhelping customers reduce their impact on the environment \\nthrough our products and services. \\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\nWe design our devices to be more sustainable by measuring \\nand reducing carbon emissions at all stages of the product \\nlifecycle, from how the devices are made to how they are \\nused and ultimately disposed of. We extend our impact \\nby delivering products and experiences to help customers \\nmanage their own environmental impact. \\n\\n  Materials and Chemicals\\n\\nWe incorporate recycled materials into many new Amazon \\ndevices. In 2021, we launched several Echo, Fire TV, Fire \\nTablet, Kindle, and Smart Home devices and accessories \\nthat include up to 60% recycled molded plastic, up to \\n100% recycled fabrics, up to 100% recycled aluminum, \\nand up to 70% recycled magnesium, depending on the \\nproduct. We also incorporated 50% recycled plastic into \\ncertain power adapters that ship with our devices.\\n\\nTo advance the move to safer chemistry, we joined \\nChemFORWARD \\n as a co-design partner. Through this \\npartnership, we are collaborating with industry peers to \\nproactively identify harmful chemicals and safer alternatives \\nahead of regulations.\\n\\n  Packaging\\n\\n  Reliability\\n\\n  Alexa \\n\\nIn 2020, we committed to making Amazon device packaging \\n100% recyclable by 2023. Additionally, we are working \\nto source 100% of the wood fiber in our packaging from \\nresponsibly managed forests or recycled sources. We have \\nmade significant progress toward our goals, eliminating \\nmore than 29 million plastic bags from our device packaging \\nbetween September 2020 and September 2021. For new \\nEcho, Fire TV Stick, Fire Tablet, and Kindle Paperwhite devices \\nlaunched in 2021, 94%–98% of the packaging is made \\nof wood fiber-based materials from responsibly managed \\nforests or recycled sources, depending on the product. \\n\\n  Energy\\n\\nIn 2020, Amazon became the first consumer electronics \\ncompany to commit to addressing the electricity used by our \\ndevices through renewable energy development, starting \\nwith our Echo devices. We are also making investments \\nin additional wind and solar farm capacity that, by 2025, \\nwill be equal to the energy use of Fire TV and Ring devices \\nworldwide. Combined, we expect these projects will produce \\nover 5 million megawatt-hours of clean energy per year—\\nthat’s enough to power more than 400,000 homes.\\n\\nTo accompany our investments in renewable energy, we also \\ncontinue to make our devices more energy efficient. We have \\nbeen rolling out Low Power Mode to new devices, as well as \\nto older devices already in customers’ homes. By the end of \\n2021, over 50% of all Echo and Fire TV devices in customers’ \\nhomes had Low Power Mode. We also launched a number of \\nnew Fire Tablet, Fire TV, and Amazon Smart Home devices in \\n2021 that were designed for energy efficiency and earned \\nthe ENERGY STAR certification.\\n\\nWe design our devices with best-in-class reliability models so \\nthat they are more resilient, last longer, and don’t need to be \\nreplaced as often. We also release over-the-air software updates \\nfor our customers’ devices with feature and security updates. \\n\\n  Suppliers\\n\\nWe work with our suppliers to encourage sustainability as a \\ntop priority. In 2021, we launched our Zero Waste to Landfill \\nprogram for suppliers. Ten of our supplier sites responsible for \\nthe final assembly of some of our most popular Echo, Kindle, \\nand Fire TV devices achieved UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill Silver \\nor Platinum certification—a significant step toward achieving \\nour zero-waste ambitions. This certification indicates that \\nwaste has been handled in environmentally responsible ways, \\ndiverting more than 90% of a facility’s waste from landfill \\nthrough methods other than waste to energy. \\n\\n  Climate Pledge Friendly\\n\\nWe partner with trusted and transparent external \\ncertifications to validate the sustainability of our products \\nand clearly communicate this to customers with the Climate \\nPledge Friendly label. In 2020 and 2021, our Echo, Fire TV, \\nFire Tablet, Kindle Paperwhite, and Smart Home devices and \\naccessories launched with the Climate Pledge Friendly \\nlabel. Many of these products carry the Carbon Trust’s \\nReducing CO2 certification, demonstrating a reduction \\nin the carbon emissions of a product year over year. The \\nAmazon Smart Thermostat is the first Amazon device to be \\nECOLOGO Silver certified—a certification that demonstrates \\nproducts meet standards that can reduce the environmental \\nimpact of one or more stages of the product lifecycle.\\n\\n  \\n\\n, \\n\\nWe are making it easier for customers to understand their \\nhome energy use with the Alexa energy dashboard \\navailable in the U.S. The dashboard works with compatible \\nsmart lights, plugs, switches, water heaters, thermostats, \\ntelevisions, and Echo devices, allowing customers to easily \\nestimate the energy used by these devices. Customers \\ncan also enable Alexa to help them conserve energy with \\nHunches. For example, if Alexa has a Hunch that a customer \\nis away and forgot to turn off a light, Alexa can automatically \\nturn it off, helping customers save energy and reduce \\ncarbon emissions. \\n\\n  Extending Our Impact\\n\\n, focused on how we are integrating carbon-\\n\\nTo drive change beyond our business, we look for ways to \\nshare learnings and innovations that have shaped the way \\nwe design our products. This allows others to leverage our \\nexpertise and make more-sustainable products for their \\nown customers. In early 2022, we published a paper called \\nDecarbonizing and Neutralizing the Use Phase of Connected \\nDevices \\nreduction strategies across the use phase of our devices. \\nThese strategies account for an estimated 10%–15% of the \\noverall carbon footprint of rechargeable battery-operated \\ndevices and an estimated 60%–80% of the footprint of \\nplugged-in devices. At Amazon, we recognize that we cannot \\nsolve this challenge alone, and we are eager to invite other \\nconsumer electronics companies and connected device \\nmanufacturers to join the mission of driving to a net-zero \\ncarbon use phase. \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n35  \\n\\ndelivered six projects constructed with recycled steel in 2021 \\nand will expand this to all future U.S. and European data \\ncenters moving forward.\\n\\nConcrete also contributes a large share of embodied carbon \\nin data center construction, and AWS has multiple initiatives \\nto reduce the carbon impact of the concrete required. For \\nexample, our design standards now require concrete with a \\n20% reduction in embodied carbon versus standard concrete \\nfor new U.S. data centers, and we are expanding this \\nrequirement globally.\\n\\nSustainability in \\nthe Cloud\\n\\nAWS is the world’s most \\ncomprehensive and broadly \\nadopted cloud offering, with \\nmillions of global users depending \\non it every day. To build a \\nsustainable business for our \\ncustomers and for the world we all \\nshare, we are designing data centers \\nthat provide the efficient, resilient \\nservice our customers expect while \\nminimizing our environmental \\nfootprint—and theirs.\\n\\n3.6x\\n\\nAWS is 3.6 times more \\nenergy efficient than the \\nmedian of U.S. enterprise \\ndata centers surveyed\\n\\n5x\\n\\nAWS is up to five times \\nmore energy efficient than \\nthe average data center \\nsurveyed in Europe\\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\nWe focus on efficiency across all aspects of our infrastructure, \\nfrom the design of our data centers and hardware to \\nmodeling the performance of our operations for continuous \\nenhanced efficiency. We are on a path to power our \\noperations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. These \\nrenewable energy investments help power our data centers, \\nas part of our commitment to reach net-zero carbon across \\nour operations by 2040. \\n\\nFor AWS, operating sustainably also means reducing the \\namount of water we use to cool our data centers. Our holistic \\napproach minimizes both energy and water consumption in \\nour operations and guides the development of our water use \\nstrategy for each AWS Region where we operate. \\n\\nIn addition, we work to reduce the carbon emitted during the \\nextraction, manufacturing, and transportation of materials \\nto data center construction sites. Reducing this embodied \\ncarbon offers a significant opportunity to cut our overall \\nemissions from data centers. \\n\\nEnergy Efficiency\\n\\nWe are using innovation to improve power efficiency in \\nmultiple ways, including our investment in AWS-designed \\nchips and the AWS Nitro System. For instance, AWS-\\ndesigned Graviton3 is our most power-efficient general-\\npurpose processor. Graviton3-based Elastic Compute Cloud \\n(EC2) instances use up to 60% less energy for the same \\nperformance than non-Graviton EC2 instances. With the \\nworld’s increasing need for computing and as machine \\nlearning has become mainstream, continually innovating \\nat the chip level will be critical to sustainably powering the \\nworkloads of the future. \\n\\nAWS also continually innovates on cooling efficiency. For \\nexample, we worked with our vendors to optimize the \\nlongevity and airflow performance of the cooling medium \\nused in our data center cooling systems. The new medium \\nprovides twice the service life and allows air to pass through \\nmore easily than previous iterations, saving fan energy. This \\nhas significant impacts on building energy performance, \\nreducing the energy use of cooling equipment by 20%. \\n\\nPredicting and Tracking Performance\\nWe use advanced modeling methods, such as computational \\nfluid dynamics tools, to optimize our data center design. \\nThis allows us to fully understand how the data center \\nwill perform before it is ever built, enabling us to optimize \\nfor higher reliability and energy efficiency in our systems. \\nOnce our data centers are operational, real-time, physics-\\nbased models allow us to further improve and optimize our \\ndesigns. We build these custom models using AWS services \\nand weather datasets from the Amazon Sustainability \\nData Initiative to predict system performance for our sites \\nand track their performance against how they should \\nbe operating. \\n\\nReducing Embodied Carbon\\n\\nIn addition to emissions from our energy usage, AWS \\naddresses a wide range of indirect emissions—including \\nthose associated with the construction of our data centers. \\nSteel is one of the largest contributors of embodied carbon \\nin the structure of AWS data centers and we are lowering \\nthese emissions by working with mills using electric arc \\nfurnace production processes. Unlike conventional steel \\nproduced from primary materials, coal, and gas, our suppliers \\nare using up to 100% recycled content and are powered by \\nelectricity only, reducing embodied carbon up to 70%. We \\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Moving to AWS Can Help Significantly Lower Carbon\\n\\n, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence, have shown that AWS’ \\n\\nStudies by 451 Research \\ninfrastructure is more efficient than on-premises data centers.

A similar study that surveyed organizations in \\nJapan, South Korea, Singapore, Australia, and India found that, on average, moving to the \\ncloud was up to five times more energy efficient than using their on-premises data centers.\\n\\nAfter analyzing several regions, 451 Research also found that AWS can lower customers’ \\nworkload carbon footprints by nearly 80% compared to surveyed enterprise data centers, \\nand up to 96% once AWS is powered with 100% renewable energy—a target we are on \\npath to meet by 2025. \\n\\n2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n36  \\n\\nAWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool\\n\\nAs AWS continues to invest in sustainability across our \\ninfrastructure, many of our customers have asked us \\nto help measure the carbon footprint of their AWS \\nworkloads—both to understand how moving to AWS \\nreduces their carbon footprint and to report their \\noverall footprint.\\n\\nOur new customer carbon footprint tool \\n uses simple \\nvisualizations to show customers their historical carbon \\nemissions, evaluate related trends as their use of AWS \\nevolves, estimate emissions avoided by using AWS \\ninstead of an on-premises data center, and review \\nforecasted emissions based on their current usage. \\n\\nThe forecast shows how customers’ footprints will change \\nas Amazon stays on path to powering our operations with \\n100% renewable energy by 2025, five years earlier than \\nthe original target of 2030, and drives toward net-zero \\ncarbon by 2040.\\n\\nIn addition, historical carbon emissions data is available \\nbased on a customer’s AWS use from January 2020 \\nonward. This data includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 \\nemissions. Scope 1 emissions come directly from a \\ncompany’s operations, while Scope 2 emissions come \\nfrom the generation of purchased energy, such as the \\nelectricity used to power Amazon facilities. \\n\\nThe customer carbon footprint tool uses carbon data \\nthat meets the widely adopted international standard of \\nthe Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which supplies the world’s \\nmost widely used greenhouse gas accounting standards. \\nWhen signed into the AWS Billing console, customers can \\nview their carbon emissions data by geographical location \\nand by AWS service, such as EC2 and Amazon Simple \\nStorage Service (Amazon S3). They can also measure \\nchanges in their carbon footprint over time, as they \\ndeploy new resources in the cloud.\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n37  \\n\\nCommunity Water Programs\\nWater is a key resource we share with those who live where \\nwe operate, so we look for opportunities to return water \\nto these communities. For example, we partnered with the \\nCity of Umatilla and the West Extension Irrigation District \\nto deliver water to farmers in Oregon. Instead of going \\nto a wastewater treatment plant, our clean cooling water \\ngoes into a canal that delivers the water to farmers for use \\nin irrigation. With this project, we reuse up to 96% of the \\nwastewater we discharge from our data centers in this region.\\n\\nIn 2021, we funded watershed restoration efforts by \\nThe Nature Conservancy in Cape Town, South Africa, and \\n\\nSão Paulo, Brazil. These completed projects have restored \\n365 hectares of land and increased water supply availability \\nby 45 million gallons per year.\\n\\nThrough partnerships with Water.org and WaterAid in India \\nand Indonesia, we initially intended to provide clean water to \\n165,000 people. By the time these partnerships concluded in \\nearly 2022, we surpassed our goal and provided clean water \\nand sanitation to over 250,000 community members. In 2022, \\nwe began supporting a new set of projects, which include \\nwetland creation in the Thames River Basin in England and \\nwater quality projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in \\nthe U.S.\\n\\nWater Stewardship in Data Centers\\n\\nAmazon knows water is a precious resource. Our holistic \\napproach minimizes both energy and water consumption \\nin our data center operations and guides our water use \\nstrategy for each AWS Region. This starts with evaluating \\nclimate patterns, local water management and availability, \\nand opportunities to avoid using potable water sources \\nwhenever possible. We are committed to conserving and \\nreusing water, both in our on-site operations and by working \\nwith private and public entities to support water availability \\nin communities where we operate data centers. \\n\\nEvaporative Cooling\\nOur preferred cooling strategy for data centers uses \\nevaporative technologies. We analyze the weather in each \\nregion and monitor our cooling system, which is designed \\nto maximize environmental cooling and minimize water use. \\nDuring the hottest months of the year, we have optimized \\nsystems to minimize water usage. Outside air is cooled \\nthrough an evaporative process and pushed into the server \\nrooms to keep hardware at stable operating temperatures. \\nWith this design, even our largest data centers at full \\ncapacity would use, on average, about the same water in \\na year as only 25 U.S. households. During cooler months, \\nwhere possible, outside air is supplied directly to the data \\ncenter without needing to be cooled.\\n\\nWe are constantly innovating the design of our cooling \\nsystems to further reduce water usage. We are installing \\nsensors that provide real-time water-use data to operators \\nand sustainability teams. By analyzing this data, we can \\nidentify opportunities to reduce water usage and rapidly \\nmake operational changes.\\n\\nRecycled Water\\nWe evaluate the opportunity to reduce our consumption \\nof potable water and are actively expanding our use of \\nnonpotable and recycled water for cooling purposes. In \\ncertain regions, we work directly with utilities and regulators \\nto obtain approval for the use of recycled water in direct \\nevaporative cooling technology.

The \\nprogram provides publicly available, free access to important \\nscientific data that can otherwise be hard for researchers to \\naccess or analyze.\\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\nASDI works with scientific organizations around the world \\nto identify important datasets, which are then hosted for \\nfree by the AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program. The \\nprogram currently hosts petabytes of data including weather \\nobservations, ocean temperatures, climate projection data, \\nand satellite imagery.\\n\\nOur approach allows sustainability experts to analyze \\nmassive amounts of data in minutes, regardless of where \\nthey are in the world or how much local storage space or \\ncomputing capacity they can access. \\n\\nInnovating for Sustainability in \\nthe Cloud \\n\\nFrom university researchers to local governments and federal \\nagencies to private startups, organizations leverage ASDI to \\nhelp address major sustainability challenges. ASDI encourages \\nthis by providing cloud grants to those interested in exploring \\nthe use of AWS’ technology. Here are some examples of how \\nASDI is helping drive sustainability innovations:\\n\\nSolcast \\nSolcast is an Australian company that builds forecasts for \\nsolar industry customers using cloud cover, solar radiation, \\nand photovoltaic (PV) power data. The forecasts help solar \\nproducers predict the amount of solar irradiance and the \\namount of solar PV energy that their farms may receive. \\nSolcast’s forecasts rely on large datasets from a global fleet \\nof weather satellites, including Geostationary Operational \\nEnvironmental Satellites (GOES) data from the U.S. National \\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which \\nSolcast accesses through ASDI. \\n\\nThe data helps solar customers orchestrate renewable \\nenergy generation across electrical grids, visualize the impact \\nof thousands of PV systems, and optimize utility-scale \\nbatteries and solar farms. In addition, the data helps identify \\nthe best locations for solar farms, enabling governments \\naround the world to plan their transition toward a 100% \\nrenewable energy future. Learn more on the AWS blog \\n.\\n\\nDigital Earth Africa\\nDigital Earth Africa is a nonprofit working with African \\nnations to provide local leaders with information to plan for \\nimpacts related to climate change, like flooding, droughts, \\nand erosion. Through a collaboration with ASDI, Digital Earth \\nAfrica is using satellite imagery hosted on AWS to create a \\nplatform that helps monitor environmental conditions in the \\nAfrican continent.\\n\\nIn Zanzibar, Tanzania, government officials and the State \\nUniversity of Zanzibar are using the Digital Earth Africa \\nplatform to monitor how coastal erosion, rising sea levels, \\nand deforestation are contributing to the degradation of \\nmangrove trees on the island. The data hosted on AWS, \\nwhich local officials previously had no way to access, \\nhas helped leaders understand the need to restore their \\nmangroves and led to an effort to plant 1,000 mangrove \\nseeds per week \\n\\n.\\n\\nnauticAi\\nnauticAi is a maritime startup company from Finland that \\noffers ocean freight shipping companies a real-time cloud \\nplatform to help them operate their fleets more efficiently. \\nThe technology analyzes a variety of data, including weather \\nforecasts, engine performance, humidity, and motion, which \\noperators can use to improve ships’ performance and help \\nvessels avoid damaging storms. \\n\\nWeather data in particular can help shippers optimize their \\nroutes. Traditionally, these and other climate‐related datasets \\nhave resided around the world in large files and complex \\nsystems, making them hard to access without the aid of \\nspecialized computers. To solve this, nauticAi is leveraging \\nweather forecast data through ASDI from NOAA and the \\nFinnish Meteorological Institute. nauticAi’s technology also \\nuses machine learning and artificial intelligence tools on AWS \\nto further improve maritime operations. \\n\\nQhub\\nThe Earth Science Information Partners Lab, a scientific \\nnonprofit, is working with ASDI to extend cloud credits to \\nsupport the deployment of Qhub, a development space on \\nthe AWS Cloud that gives more than 90 scientists across four \\nU.S. government agencies an area to share and analyze data.\\n\\nThis new space enables the U.S. federal government and the \\nscientists to collaborate in ways that were previously difficult \\ndue to the lack of a shared computing infrastructure. The \\neffort has helped accelerate research on everything from \\nflooding to illegal mining while helping the scientists learn \\nthe benefits of collaborative data and computing.\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n39  \\n\\nIn This Section\\nHuman Rights \\nEmployee Benefits \\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion \\nEmployee Engagement \\nSafety, Health, and Well-Being \\nSupply Chain \\nCommunities \\n\\nSociety\\nContributing to a More\\nEquitable Society\\n\\nWe depend on the people who \\nsupport our entire value chain and \\nare committed to ensuring they are \\ntreated with dignity and respect each \\nand every day.

While the entire Board has overall \\nresponsibility for risk oversight, the Board has delegated \\nresponsibility for certain risks to its committees. \\n\\nAmong other duties and responsibilities, the Nominating \\nand Corporate Governance Committee oversees Amazon’s \\nenvironmental, social, and corporate governance policies \\nand initiatives. This includes policies and initiatives related \\nto corporate social responsibility, such as human rights \\nand ethical business practices, and related risks most \\nrelevant to Amazon’s operations and engagement with \\ncustomers, suppliers, and communities. Among other duties \\nand responsibilities, the Leadership Development and \\nCompensation Committee oversees Amazon’s strategies and \\npolicies related to human capital management, including \\ndiversity and inclusion, workplace environment and safety, \\nand corporate culture. The Committees regularly meet with \\nmanagement and review these matters.\\n\\nAs a global company, we recognize the responsibility \\nand opportunity we have to raise awareness among our \\nemployees on human rights issues. We have a central team \\nthat works across the company to operationalize human \\nrights due diligence and embed human rights considerations \\ninto everyday business decisions. We also offer trainings \\ntailored to salient human rights risks.

We engage directly with suppliers and \\ntheir workers and conduct independent audits to verify \\ncompliance with our Supply Chain Standards. We also work \\nwith suppliers on appropriate remediation measures and \\noffer partnerships and programs to help them address risks \\nand invest in worker well-being. \\n\\nWe recognize that audits alone are insufficient to drive long-\\nterm change across industries. We, like many companies \\nin similar industries, are exploring new ways to encourage \\nimprovement in worker protections. This includes supporting \\nsuppliers’ efforts to improve their grievance mechanisms, \\nsupplier capacity-building programs, worker trainings, and \\ncollaborations with other brands and civil society.

They are grounded \\nin principles of inclusivity, continuous improvement, and \\nsupply chain accountability. We engage with suppliers that \\nare committed to these same principles, and suppliers \\ncommit to these standards as a condition of doing business \\nwith us. At least every three years, in line with industry best \\npractices, we review our Supply Chain Standards against \\npolicies developed by industry associations.

As part of this effort, in 2021, Amazon \\nHandmade and Nest teamed up to support artisan and maker \\nbusinesses to increase their sales and impact by leveraging \\nthe power of Amazon’s marketplace. Nest, a nonprofit \\nsupporting the responsible growth and creative engagement \\nof the artisan and maker economy to drive gender equity, \\nsupports a growing network of over 1,600 artisan businesses \\nacross 120 countries. The partnership between Nest and \\nAmazon Handmade led to the launch of a dedicated cohort \\nof Nest artisan businesses that were promoted through a \\ndedicated gateway on Amazon Handmade.\\n\\nIn the wake of COVID-19, providing artisan businesses with \\na multichannel sales strategy is essential to their resilience \\nand ability to withstand unprecedented times for small \\nmaker businesses. For example, Espacio Handmade, based in \\nAustin, Texas, is a women-owned leather goods business that \\nwas highlighted in our 2020 Sustainability Report. Amazon \\nHandmade also featured the business in the “Our Favorite \\nFinds” section, and within weeks, Espacio Handmade had \\nreceived hundreds of orders.

As of \\n2021, we supported nearly 16,000 workers—including \\n10,000 women—with trainings on health and financial \\nskills, and we helped workers and factory management to \\ncombat gender-based discrimination in the workplace.\\n\\nSunita Giri is a garment worker at Dhruv Globals Ltd. \\nin India who attended a HERfinance program. She is a \\n\\nsingle mother of two children, and her family depends on \\nher income alone. Through HERfinance training, Sunita \\nlearned the value of investing and saving for health and \\nfuture expenses. The training taught her about financial \\nplanning tools and options to build her savings to support \\nher short-term and long-term goals. It also inspired her to \\nopen a savings account, where she regularly deposits funds, \\nand enabled her to use digital payment tools that support \\nfair wage payments.

We have \\ndedicated teams across the globe that work directly with \\nsuppliers to track and report performance against these \\nstandards. Our suppliers are required to pay legally required \\ncompensation, including overtime and benefits, and we \\nencourage them to continually evaluate whether their \\nworkers earn enough to meet their basic needs and the \\nneeds of their families.\\n\\nMaking sure workers are paid fairly is a challenge across \\nall industries in global supply chains. We are working to \\nbetter understand wage payments in our supply chain to \\nmeaningfully engage with suppliers and enhance our due \\ndiligence under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and \\nHuman Rights on this issue. We will continue to enroll our \\nsuppliers in international programs that improve livelihoods, \\nhelp suppliers invest in worker well-being, and contribute \\nto the social and economic development of regions where \\nwe source and operate. Programs such as SCORE and \\nBetter Work address the holistic challenges workers face by \\nfocusing on improving working conditions and promoting \\nrespect for labor rights. An independent impact assessment \\nof the SCORE program found increased productivity and \\nincreased wages for Amazon suppliers participating in \\nthe program. \\n\\nResponsible Recruitment and Freely \\nChosen Employment \\nAmazon does not tolerate the use of forced labor. Forced \\nlabor is a hidden crime that is hard to combat, and workplace \\nenvironments and recruitment practices are dynamic. For \\nvulnerable groups such as foreign migrant workers, we are \\nincreasing our understanding of forced labor risk across both \\nhome and destination countries. Worker voice mechanisms \\nare important to enable workers to raise issues in a safe \\nand confidential manner. We recognize real progress in this \\nspace will only be achieved through collaborative action—\\nby companies, governments, and civil society—to spur \\nsystemwide change. \\n\\nWith operations and supply chains spanning the globe, we \\nare committed to improving the working conditions of people \\nwho are connected to our business and recognize the need \\nto monitor for conditions that put workers at risk of modern \\nslavery. We work to identify and reduce the risk of forced \\nlabor. Our Supply Chain Standards prohibit all forms of forced \\nlabor and human trafficking, and set requirements aimed at \\nreducing risk. For example, workers must not be required to \\npay recruitment fees, and suppliers must not retain passports \\nor personal documentation. During assessments of Amazon-\\nbranded suppliers, we track where workers migrated from and \\nhow much they paid in recruitment fees. If fees have been paid, \\nwe require the supplier to reimburse workers in full. \\n\\nIn 2021, we expanded our relationships with key external \\npartners RBA and the International Organization for Migration \\n(IOM). We also began partnering with the Issara Institute to \\naddress issues of human trafficking and forced labor through \\nworker voice, partnership, and innovation. We are working with \\nthese organizations to better understand hotspots across our \\nsupply chain so that the rights of workers vulnerable to forced \\nlabor continue to be respected and promoted. We are also \\nworking with them to leverage collective industry responses for \\nimproved due diligence and develop impactful risk mitigation \\nstrategies that put the interests of workers first.\\n\\nAdditionally, we expanded our training on responsible \\nrecruitment practices to over 50 suppliers through the RBA’s \\nResponsible Labor Initiative and IOM. We also offered worker \\nawareness training to workers at sites in high-risk regions to \\nimprove the well-being of foreign migrant workers. These \\ntraining programs focused on modern slavery risks and the \\nimportance of responsible recruitment, including teaching \\nparticipants how to implement effective risk mitigation \\ncontrols, identify issues in their recruitment and hiring processes \\nfor migrant workers, and draft an implementation plan for \\naddressing these issues. \\n\\nStanding in Partnership Against  \\nChild Labor\\n\\nThe UN designated 2021 as International Year for the \\nElimination of Child Labour. Building on our work with \\nThe Centre for Child Rights and Business, Amazon \\ncommitted to the Joint Action Pledge to strengthen \\nthe protection of children’s rights and accelerate \\naction to address child labor in global supply chains. \\n\\nThrough this commitment, we will work with other \\nretailers to further extend due diligence, remediation, \\nand monitoring activities. This will enable us to \\nincrease our understanding of child labor in supply \\nchains, deliver programs to support juvenile workers, \\nbuild the capabilities of suppliers to address child labor, \\nwork collaboratively as a group to share learnings, and \\nestablish best practices to address child labor.\\n\\n“  Amazon is committed to ensuring our \\nproducts and services are provided in \\na way that respects human rights, and \\ncombating forced and child labor in \\nglobal supply chains is an important part \\nof that pledge.

AWS works with Polaris to infuse \\ncutting-edge technology into its infrastructure to accelerate \\nthe development of the largest known U.S. dataset on \\ntrafficking. With the guidance of survivors, Polaris uses \\nthat data to improve the way trafficking is identified, how \\nvictims and survivors are assisted, and how communities, \\nbusinesses, and governments can prevent human trafficking \\nby transforming the underlying inequities and oppressions \\nthat make it possible.\\n\\n•  Amazon is a member of the Responsible Labor Initiative, \\n\\na multi-industry, multistakeholder initiative focused on \\nensuring that the rights of workers vulnerable to forced \\nlabor in global supply chains are consistently respected \\nand promoted. \\n\\n•  Amazon partners with StolenYouth, a Seattle-based \\n\\norganization with the mission to end child sex trafficking \\nin the state of Washington through prevention, connecting \\ntrafficked youth to resources and services, and empowering \\nsurvivors along their path to recovery and a promising \\nfuture. We support StolenYouth by providing both financial \\nsupport and goods donations. \\n\\n•  Tech Against Trafficking is a coalition of companies \\n\\ncollaborating with global experts to help eradicate \\nhuman trafficking using technology. Amazon sits on the \\norganization’s steering committee and has leveraged \\nthe expertise and resources of AWS to help explore and \\nscale the use of technology solutions across the anti-\\ntrafficking field. \\n\\n•  Thorn, an organization that builds technology to defend \\n\\nchildren from sexual abuse, leverages AWS machine learning \\ntools in its Spotlight product. Spotlight’s sophisticated \\nmachine learning capabilities save time for investigators by \\nautomatically flagging ads likely to represent victims of child \\nsex trafficking. Investigators search Spotlight’s constantly \\ngrowing database of ads and set up automated alerts to \\nempower proactive investigations. Spotlight has helped \\nidentify more than 20,000 child sex trafficking victims.\\n\\n•  Amazon is an official corporate sponsor of Truckers \\n\\nAgainst Trafficking (TAT), an organization dedicated to \\ncombating human trafficking in the trucking industry. We \\nbegan incorporating TAT training modules into trainings for \\nour internal fleet of drivers to teach them how to identify \\nand respond to potential victims of human trafficking. Since \\nlaunching this partnership, we have trained over 9,000 \\nAmazon transportation associates.\\n\\n•  We support the UK-wide Modern Slavery & Exploitation \\nHelpline operated by Unseen, investing in its efforts to \\nprovide immediate and long-term assistance to potential \\nvictims of modern slavery and to ensure the helpline’s \\ncontinued growth. The helpline provides direct response and \\nservices to potential victims of modern slavery and helps \\nshape trainings and wider services for vulnerable people.\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##These organizations are key to helping our suppliers listen \\nto their workers and raise awareness of issues in our supply \\nchain. We provide our suppliers and service providers with \\nthese tools in order to help them hear directly from workers \\nabout their experiences, and to support the resolution \\nof issues from the workers’ perspectives. Across these \\nmechanisms used in 2021, 92% of closed issues have had \\nworker verification of remedial actions.\\n\\nAs an example of our work in this area, we enrolled our \\nBangladeshi suppliers in Amader Kotha, a helpline that \\nprovides workers in the ready-made garment sector a \\nsafe and effective way to report and resolve workplace \\nissues. We provide ongoing capacity-building to suppliers \\nenrolled in Amader Kotha, assisting with grievance handling \\nmechanisms and worker voice tools. In our third year of \\nworking with Amader Kotha, we are seeing significant \\nimpact. More than 88% of workers employed with our \\nBangladeshi suppliers reported that they were satisfied with \\nthe usage of the Amader Kotha Helpline. In 2021, workers \\nplaced 530 calls to the helpline—86% related to labor issues \\nand 4.6% related to safety issues. These cases are resolved \\ndirectly in partnership with factory management in line  \\nwith the helpline’s protocols.\\n\\nLearn more about our spotlight on worker voice \\n\\n.\\n\\nEnvironmental Protection\\nWe are committed to sourcing products and services that do \\nnot cause unnecessary environmental harm, and work with \\nindustry experts on ways to understand the environmental \\nimpact of our products. We are a member of the Sustainable \\nApparel Coalition, an industrywide group of leading apparel \\nand footwear brands, retailers, manufacturers, NGOs, \\nacademic experts, and government organizations working \\nto reduce the environmental and social impacts of apparel \\nproducts around the world. \\n\\nWe encourage our Amazon-branded suppliers to evaluate \\ntheir practices using the Coalition’s Higg Index, a tool to \\nhelp manufacturers measure the social and environmental \\nperformance of their facilities. We are committed to driving \\nadoption of this assessment and helping our suppliers \\nunderstand their environmental impacts. Our aim is to work \\nwith industry partners and our suppliers to understand \\ntheir environmental footprints and set goals to reduce \\nenvironmental impacts. \\n\\nAccess to Effective Grievance Mechanisms\\nWe are building our efforts to provide people connected \\nto our value chain with access to effective grievance \\nmechanisms as part of our supply chain due diligence and \\ninvestments in worker well-being, and have added this as \\na key commitment area. \\n\\nWe help our suppliers work with a number of global partners \\nto provide supply chain workers with access to effective \\ngrievance mechanisms, including the Amader Kotha Helpline \\nin Bangladesh; Ulula in China, Cambodia, India, Pakistan, \\nand the UK; the amfori SPEAK FOR CHANGE Programme \\nin Vietnam; the Responsible Labor Initiative’s Suara Kami \\nhelpline in Malaysia; and Sedex Direct Worker Reporting \\nin India. \\n\\n2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n67  \\n\\nCommodities and Traceability \\n\\nAssessing and Mapping Risk\\nCommodity supply chains are complicated and fragmented, \\nand improved visibility into raw material supply chains better \\nenables businesses to identify human rights and labor rights \\nviolations and hold suppliers accountable. \\n\\nIn 2021, we completed our first commodity and materiality \\nrisk assessment for Amazon-branded products and identified \\neight commodities with salient social and environmental risks \\nas a key milestone in the development of our responsible \\ncommodity sourcing roadmap. \\n\\nFocus on Cotton \\nIn 2021, we continued to strengthen our efforts to address \\nhuman rights risks in global cotton supply chains. Amazon \\njoined Better Cotton’s Retailer and Brand Advisory Panel \\non Traceability to help steer Better Cotton’s initial vision \\nand strategy toward achieving more traceable cotton in \\nthe coming years. We also participated in the Responsible \\nSourcing Network’s initiative YESS: Yarn Ethically & \\nSustainably Sourced. YESS works to address forced labor \\nin the cotton value chain by providing training to, and \\nmanaging the assessment of, spinners and fabric mills to \\nidentify and address forced labor in cotton production. \\n\\nFocus on Minerals \\nIn 2021, we increased our support for industry collaboration \\ntoward responsible mineral sourcing. We remain members \\nof the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals \\nTrade and the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). We also \\nenhanced our cobalt due diligence program using the RMI’s \\ncobalt reporting template.\\n\\nWe supported RMI’s Smelter Audit Fund to increase \\nassessments for tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold smelters. \\nThese assessments are critical to responsible mineral \\n\\nsourcing in our supply chains. In 2022, we will implement \\nadditional smelter due diligence protocols as we work toward \\n100% of tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold mineral smelters \\nand refiners in our supply chain being certified using a \\nrecognized minerals assurance program. \\n\\nPurchasing Practices\\nSupplier feedback on our purchasing practices is important \\nin understanding how we can improve supplier relationships \\nand understanding our potential impact on human rights in \\nour supply chain. In 2021, Amazon partnered with the Better \\nBuying Institute to capture anonymous supplier feedback \\non our purchasing practices through an annual survey. \\nBenchmarked against industry peers, we identified key areas, \\nincluding planning and forecasting, supplier engagement, \\nand on-time payments, where we can improve practices to \\ndrive a better supplier experience of working with Amazon.\\n\\nIn 2021, Amazon partnered with Better Buying and other \\nbrands to create an e-learning course to raise awareness \\nabout the importance of the issue.\\n\\nWe are proud to have been part of the effort to \\nend state-imposed forced labor in Uzbekistan’s \\ncotton sector. In 2019, Amazon signed the \\nCotton Campaign’s Uzbek Cotton Pledge with \\nover 300 brands and retailers to raise awareness \\nand oppose the systemic use of forced labor in \\nUzbekistan’s cotton production.

These categories are divided \\ninto subcategories, such as nondiscrimination, emergency \\npreparedness, hazardous substances, and transparency. \\nFindings within each subcategory are flagged as High, \\nMedium, or Low depending on the level of severity. Amazon \\nfocuses on setting a high bar for new suppliers and refusing \\nto go to production until suppliers remediate High-level \\nfindings identified in our assessments. We recognize that \\nsome issues may take time to effectively remediate. For \\nMedium-level issues, we expect suppliers to show they \\nare making meaningful progress toward remediation \\nwithin a defined timeline. For Low-level issues, we monitor \\nsuppliers for continual improvement. We have dedicated \\nteams based in key sourcing countries around the globe \\nthat work directly with our suppliers to identify solutions to \\nchallenging problems and promote open dialogue. We seek \\nto create long-term relationships with suppliers that align \\nwith our values and are committed to constantly improving \\nconditions. Where we see trends in issues beyond individual \\nsuppliers, such as widespread health and safety deficits or \\nindustrywide failures to responsibly protect migrant workers, \\nwe work to define regional or global strategies to address \\nunderlying systemic challenges. \\n\\n data (see Appendix) \\n\\nWe share our supplier assessment \\nto demonstrate our commitment to transparency and \\ncontribute to industrywide knowledge on complex and \\nchanging supply chain conditions. In 2021, we conducted \\n5,952 assessments to help us determine which suppliers \\nto work with and, for those we do engage, to help us \\nunderstand and continually improve those suppliers’ \\npractices. We utilize three types of assessments: \\n\\n•   Pre-Production Assessments: Suppliers must submit \\n\\nan Amazon-approved assessment of their facilities \\nbefore beginning production of Amazon-branded \\nproducts (28% of assessments conducted in 2021 \\nwere Pre-Production Assessments). \\n\\n•   Ongoing Assessments: Suppliers must submit Amazon-\\n\\napproved assessments on an ongoing basis while producing \\nAmazon products (51% of assessments conducted in 2021 \\nwere Ongoing Assessments). \\n\\n•   Verification Assessments: Where issues are identified, \\nsuppliers must develop a corrective action plan detailing \\nactions to address identified issues and a long-term \\nplan to prevent reoccurrence, and where necessary, \\nmust undergo a follow-up assessment to remediate \\nissues (21% of assessments conducted in 2021 were \\nVerification Assessments).\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n69  \\n\\nOur Approach \\n\\nWorking alongside community partners, we create solutions \\nto some of the world’s most pressing challenges and build \\nlong-term programs that have a lasting, positive impact. \\nWe work to address immediate needs, such as reducing \\nhunger and homelessness, providing affordable housing, and \\nserving communities in need following natural disasters.

To \\naccelerate this process, Amazon analyzed data across four \\nyears of support to prepare ahead of hurricane season in \\nthe U.S. and Caribbean. \\n\\nWe donated and pre-stocked over 500,000 relief \\nsupplies in our hub, which spans 10,000 cubic feet—\\nbig enough to fill an Amazon Air 767 cargo plane. This \\npreparation ensured readiness for helping six of Amazon’s \\nhumanitarian relief partners, and the hub was instrumental \\nin providing support to Louisiana communities following \\nHurricane Ida. \\n\\n“  Amazon’s donation of critical relief supplies \\nand advance pre-positioning efforts allow \\nthe American Red Cross to stand ready to \\nhelp at a moment’s notice.

In 2021, more than 100 million packages were delivered to our customers’ doorsteps across Europe with a fleet of over 3,000 \\nelectric delivery vans and other zero-emission vehicles. Also in 2021, more than half a million packages were delivered to our customers’ doorsteps in North America with electric \\nvehicles (EVs). Approximately 8% of Amazon shipments were delivered to customers in North America and Europe without additional packaging in 2021.\\n\\nTo decarbonize our transportation network, we are deploying zero-emission vehicles, using low-carbon fuels, investing in emerging technologies, and collaborating to accelerate \\ncross-sector innovation. In 2019, we ordered 100,000 custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian and thousands more from manufacturers such as Stellantis and Mahindra  \\nElectric. We started deploying battery EV trucks across our heavy commercial trucking fleets and began switching to vehicles that use alternative fuel sources, like compressed \\nnatural gas trucks. Micromobility technologies, such as cargo bikes and walkers, are used to deliver packages in urban settings.

See our public methodology \\nannounced as of the end of 2021, Amazon is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy. In 2021, we reached 85% renewable energy across our business, with more than 12 gigawatts of renewable energy production capacity \\nacross our global portfolio. Once these projects are fully operational, they are expected to deliver up to 33,700 gigawatt-hours of energy annually—the electricity output equivalent to powering more than 3 million U.S. homes for one year.\\n\\n for more on our approach.. With 274 renewable energy projects \\n\\nIn 2021, we expanded our renewable energy footprint into new geographies, and by the end of the year, announced renewable energy projects across 18 countries. Our first solar projects in South Africa and the United Arab Emirates came \\nonline and we announced new projects in locations including Singapore, Japan, Australia, and China. Our projects in South Africa and Japan are the first corporate-backed, utility-scale solar farms in these countries. \\n\\nRead more about our investments in renewable energy \\n\\n on pages 20–21.\\n\\nClassification\\n\\nEnergy Source; Resilience\\n\\nOur Buildings\\nAmazon is working to reduce the carbon emissions associated with our buildings, from the carbon embodied in construction materials to the operational emissions from powering our activities. We leverage industry best practices and \\nemerging technologies in facility design and operation to drive reductions across carbon, energy, water, and waste. \\n\\nResource Efficiency; Energy Source; \\nResilience\\n\\nIn 2021, we unveiled our latest plans for sustainable design enhancements at PenPlace \\n, the second phase of our HQ2 development in Virginia. From the start, sustainability has been a key element of our HQ2 campus, with commitments \\nto use 100% renewable energy, reduce embodied carbon from construction, and achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification, the highest sustainability certification for a development issued by the \\nU.S. Green Building Council. In early 2022, our Amazon Fresh location in Seattle, Washington, became the world’s first grocery store to pursue Zero Carbon Certification from the International Living Future Institute. \\n\\nRead more about how we incorporate sustainability into our buildings \\n\\n on pages 22–23.\\n\\nTransportation\\nDecarbonizing our transportation network is a key part of meeting The Climate Pledge by 2040 and making 50% of shipments net-zero carbon by 2030, which is why we are actively transforming our fleet network and operations. We are \\ndeploying zero-emission vehicles, using low-carbon fuels, investing in emerging technologies, and collaborating with others to accelerate cross-sector innovation. \\n\\nResource Efficiency; Energy Source\\n\\nIn 2019, we ordered 100,000 custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian and thousands more from global manufacturers such as Stellantis and Mahindra Electric. In 2021, more than 100 million packages were delivered to customers’ \\ndoorsteps across Europe with a fleet of over 3,000 electric delivery vans and other zero-emission vehicles. Also in 2021, more than half a million packages were delivered to customers’ doorsteps in North America with electric vehicles (EVs).\\n\\nWe also started deploying battery EV trucks across our heavy commercial trucking fleets and began switching to vehicles that use alternative fuel sources, like compressed natural gas trucks. Micromobility technologies, such as cargo bikes \\nand walkers, are used to deliver packages in urban settings. In 2021, we helped launch Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels and became a founding private sector member of the First Movers Coalition to lead decarbonization of the \\nmaritime shipping industry. \\n\\nRead more about how we are decarbonizing our transportation network \\n\\n on pages 24–25.\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n94  \\n\\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nWaste and Recycling\\nAmazon is working to send less material to landfills and more back into the circular economy loop by developing waste-prevention and -reuse programs within our own operations and for our customers. Through Amazon Second Chance, \\nwe offer customers access to a range of services to recycle, repair, or trade in their items, as well as shop for like-new and refurbished products. At our global fulfillment centers, we use software to identify and sort eligible items that are fit \\nfor donation. We partner with local community organizations to collect these items from Amazon facilities and distribute them to people in need. Since 2019, Amazon has contributed more than 100 million products to our global charity \\npartners in North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan.\\n\\nWe work with third-party recycling haulers to remove excess corrugated board from our facilities for off-site recycling. Many of these haulers also supply Amazon with the packaging materials that we use for customer shipments, \\nconverting waste material recovered from Amazon operations into new, recycled packaging. For plastic film, which is not commonly accepted through municipal recycling programs, we have developed on-site recycling systems that enable \\nus to convert plastic film into bags made of 100% recycled material.\\n\\nWe incorporate recycled plastics, fabrics, and metals into many new Amazon devices, giving new life to materials that could have otherwise ended up in waste streams. In 2021, we launched several Echo, Fire TV, Fire Tablet, Kindle, and \\nSmart Home devices and accessories that include up to 60% recycled molded plastic, up to 100% recycled fabrics, up to 100% recycled aluminum, and up to 70% recycled magnesium, depending on the product. \\n\\nRead more about how we are reducing waste and improving recycling \\n\\n on pages 26–27.\\n\\nClassification\\n\\nResource Efficiency; Products \\nand Services\\n\\nPackaging\\nWe work to reinvent and simplify our sustainable packaging options using a science-based approach that combines lab testing, machine learning, materials science, and manufacturing partnerships to scale sustainable change across the \\npackaging supply chain. Frustration-Free Packaging (FFP) is our flagship program to offer more-sustainable packaging that is easy to open, fully recyclable, and capable of shipping without additional packaging protection. By the end of \\n2021, more than 2 million products qualified under our FFP programs. Since 2015, we have reduced per-shipment packaging weight by 38% and eliminated over 1.5 million tons of packaging. \\n\\nResource Efficiency; Products \\nand Services\\n\\nRead more about how we are improving our packaging \\n\\n on pages 28–29.\\n\\nProduct Sustainability \\nAs part of our mission to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, we are giving customers access to products that are more sustainable. This includes both our Amazon-branded products and the third-party items we offer that feature \\nsustainability certifications through our Climate Pledge Friendly program. Since we launched Climate Pledge Friendly in 2020, the number of products included in the program has grown from 75,000 to more than 250,000. In 2021, more \\nthan 370 million Climate Pledge Friendly units were shipped to Amazon customers, and we welcomed 20 new third-party sustainability certifications to the program. In early 2022, we launched Amazon Aware, a new line of everyday \\nessential items, all with third-party certifications featured in our Climate Pledge Friendly program. \\n\\nResource Efficiency; Products \\nand Services\\n\\nIn addition to offering more-sustainable choices, we want our Amazon Private Brands to support responsible supply chains and contribute to growing circular economies. We are working to enhance the certification and traceability of key \\nraw materials and ingredients in our consumable products. We participate in industry partnerships and working groups that drive greater adoption of sustainable and responsible practices. Additionally, we are increasing the amount of \\nrecycled fiber used in many of our Amazon Private Brands apparel products.\\n\\nRead more about our commitment to product sustainability \\n\\n on pages 30–34.\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix \\n\\n95  \\n\\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nSustainability in the Cloud\\nAs the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud offering, we are designing data centers that provide the efficient, resilient service our customers expect while minimizing our environmental footprint—and theirs.
