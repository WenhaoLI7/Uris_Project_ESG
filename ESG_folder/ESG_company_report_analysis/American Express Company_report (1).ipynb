    "## Summary\n",
    "Environment, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) refers to the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business.  These criteria help to better determin the future financial performance of companies (return and risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis extracts text from a ESG report in PDF format from the internet, performs NLP on these information, summaries the key ESG initiatives with WordClouds, TDIDFs and discovers topics by building a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that ESG is a broad topic.  Different companies focus on different aspects of ESG depending on their business operations and culture.  One can potentially ingest more ESG reports from different companies across all sectors and industries to capture relevant ESG topics.  This to be attempted in another analysis."

That’s because we’ve long \\nunderstood that the key to sustaining our \\nenterprise is a willingness to evolve it, to \\nanticipate changes in the environment and to \\nadapt Abbott in ways that make us best able to \\nachieve our fundamental purpose — helping \\npeople live healthier, fuller lives. \\n\\nWe’ve amply demonstrated that ability \\nthroughout our history, strategically \\nreshaping Abbott to become one of the \\nworld’s leading health technology companies, \\nwith a broad portfolio and global reach that \\nlet us help more people than ever before.\\n\\nThe past few years have been among the \\nmost challenging in our lifetimes, but they’ve \\nalso highlighted for us the critical nature of \\nthe work we do and the significant positive \\nimpact we can have for patients and for the \\ncommunities in which we operate. \\n\\nBut we know that if we want to sustain that \\nimpact in a changing world, we can’t rely \\non the same playbooks we’ve used before. \\nSo, incorporating input from internal and \\n\\nexternal stakeholders, we developed a 10-year \\nplan to identify the areas we need to focus on \\nin order to grow sustainably.\\n\\nCentral to this plan is the idea that we can do \\nthe most good by pursuing our fundamental \\nmission as a company: bringing life-changing \\ntechnologies and products to the people and \\nplaces that need them. That’s why we’re \\nbuilding affordability into our products to \\nincrease access to them, and breaking down \\nbarriers that prevent people from getting \\nthe care they need. And to support that \\ncore purpose, we’ve set ourselves ambitious \\ngoals in key areas that strengthen our \\nfoundation for the future, including building \\nthe workforce of tomorrow, responsibly \\napplying data to advance care, building a \\nmore resilient, diverse and responsible supply \\nchain, and protecting health by safeguarding \\nthe environment.\\n\\nThis report is the first to detail the progress \\nwe’ve made on these 2030 goals and, as you’ll \\nread, we’re making real strides in all of these \\nareas. We’re setting the foundation for our \\nlong-term success, but we’re also remaining \\nresponsive to the pressing issues of today.\\n\\nFor example, our contributions to the fight \\nagainst COVID-19 remained important and \\nimpactful (see page 6). We also stepped up \\nin a variety of ways in response to the crisis \\nin Ukraine, donating $6 million in funding \\nand much-needed products to rebuild \\ncritical healthcare infrastructure and deliver \\nemergency and primary healthcare services \\nand supplies, working with humanitarian \\norganizations including International \\nMedical Corps, Americares, CARE and  \\nProject HOPE.\\n\\nThe values that drove those actions were \\nalso in evidence in our decision, in 2022, \\nto recall infant formula produced at one of \\nour U.S. plants (see page 60). Our people \\nare committed to our Customer Pledge to \\nmake our products as if they’re for our own \\nfamilies; and we’ll be redoubling our efforts – \\nacross every business, across every part of the \\nglobe – to ensure that our long-established \\nreputation for excellence and the highest \\nproduct quality will remain our bedrock. \\n\\nAt Abbott, we’re in the business of making \\npeople’s lives better, and we manage all \\naspects of the company to ensure we’ll \\nbe doing that for decades to come. Our \\nfundamental goal is simple: we are working \\nfor a world with fewer barriers — one that \\nenables people to live their fullest possible \\nlives — creating healthier people, healthier \\ncommunities and a healthier world.\\n\\nSincerely, \\n\\nRobert B.

In addition to \\ndistributing personal protective equipment \\n(PPE) and maintaining rigorous cleaning \\nprocesses, we established programs that help \\nkeep everyone healthy. These included providing \\nat-home tests in the U.S. and establishing several \\non-site testing and vaccination facilities. And we \\nconducted more than 2 million diagnostic tests \\nfor employees at more than 100 Abbott sites.\\n\\nFOR OUR CUSTOMERS \\nThe degree to which people rely on rapid \\ndiagnostic products has only become more \\napparent over the past two years. We know \\ntesting is the first line of defense against \\nCOVID-19 and have produced 12 COVID-19 \\ntests for both high-volume laboratories and \\ndoctors’ offices to date. We have also innovated \\nquick, efficient distribution methods, including: \\n\\n• •  Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test \\n\\nvending machines at the National \\nUniversity of Singapore. \\n\\n• •  ID NOW rapid molecular testing sites in  \\n\\n13 airports across India.\\n\\n• •  Partnering with United Airlines to offer \\n\\nat-home tests for travelers returning to the \\nU.S. that meet Centers for Disease Control \\nand Prevention (CDC) guidelines.\\n\\nIN OUR COMMUNITIES \\nWe maintained focus on helping develop \\ninfrastructure to support vaccine rollouts, \\nequitable testing access and COVID-19 \\neducation. To date, we have invested more \\nthan $41 million across 66 countries. In India, \\nwhere cases spiked in May 2021, Abbott and the \\nAbbott Fund supported the efforts of our local \\ncitizenship partner, Self Employed Women’s \\nAssociation (SEWA), to restore livelihoods for \\nlow-income communities, creating awareness \\non COVID-19 prevention, symptoms and \\ntreatment, and building temporary quarantine \\ncenters. Through our global nongovernmental \\norganization (NGO) partners, CARE and \\nAmericares, we supported district and civil \\nhospitals with essential equipment and other \\nsupplies, helping expand capacities of healthcare \\n\\nfacilities. We also supported government \\norganizations on frontline duty with our \\npharmaceuticals and nutrition products.\\n\\nWe continued to partner with Rush University \\nMedical Center and the Alive Faith Network \\nin Chicago, deploying testing and screening \\nfor over 2,400 people. In Minneapolis, we \\nworked with the University of Minnesota \\nCommunity-University Health Care Center \\nto deliver services to 3,600 patients impacted \\nby COVID-19. \\n\\nIn Waukegan and North Chicago, Illinois, we \\nhelped prepare 200 children and their families \\nfor the fall semester through sponsorship of \\nthe Boys & Girls Club of Lake County’s in-\\nperson summer program. We also provided \\ngrants to three schools in Waukegan to \\n\\nprovide families with basic needs, including \\nemergency support.\\n\\nFOR THE FUTURE\\nEarly virus detection is key to preventing — or \\nquickly responding to — future pandemics. \\nIn March 2021, building on our decades-long \\nhistory of viral surveillance, we launched the \\nAbbott Pandemic Defense Coalition to identify \\nand help contain emerging health threats.  \\n\\nREAD MORE ON PAGE 19\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nAbout Abbott\\n\\nAbbott is a global healthcare company, dedicated to improving people’s health at all \\nages and stages of life.

And we’re harnessing our global \\npresence, developing strategic partnerships, \\nand investing in community projects and \\nsustainable infrastructure to help ensure \\nequitable access to quality healthcare. \\n\\nThe Scientific Governing Board\\nThe responsibility for driving life-changing \\nhealth innovations is within the purview  \\nof Abbott’s Scientific Governing Board.  \\nThe board’s 16 members include the heads of \\nresearch and development (R&D) from all of \\nAbbott’s businesses. Together they represent \\ndecades of experience in health technology \\nand science industries. \\n\\nThe Scientific Governing Board meets monthly \\nto discuss Abbott’s progress on innovating to \\nadvance access and affordability, developments \\n\\nin health technology and areas where cross-\\nbusiness collaboration could support novel \\nproduct designs. This group is responsible \\nfor driving our product design principles into \\neach Abbott business. It also puts forward \\nnominations for Abbott’s Volwiler Society, \\nan organization we established in 1985 to \\nrecognize, support and celebrate our most \\ndistinguished scientists and engineers for \\ncreating breakthrough technologies that \\nchange millions of lives around the world. \\n\\nNominees must meet rigorous criteria  \\nand demonstrate a history of consistent \\nscientific and technical contributions.  \\nHaving a program like this in place is \\ntestament to the importance Abbott places \\non innovation.\\n\\nToday, the Volwiler Society has 125 members, \\nseveral of whom are also members of \\nthe American Institute for Medical and \\nBiological Engineering (AIMBE) — a \\nnonprofit organization representing the most \\naccomplished individuals in these fields. \\n\\nThe AIMBE brings together over 1,500 people \\nfrom academia, industry, government and \\nscientific societies to create an influential \\nnetwork of experts committed to advancing \\nmedical and biological engineering for the \\ngood of society.\\n\\nScott Muerhoff, a Distinguished Research Fellow \\nin Abbott’s Volwiler Society, drove development \\nof the biologics for Abbott’s COVID-19 serology \\nportfolio, contributing to four important assays, \\nincluding the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test.\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nInnovating for Impact\\n\\nBy 2030, we plan to improve the lives \\nof one in every three people a year, \\nproviding increasingly accessible \\nsolutions and delivering more to under-\\nresourced areas. \\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nIn 2021, Abbott products made a difference in \\nthe lives of more than 2.2 billion people, and \\nthe Abbott Fund worked with 62 partners in \\n245 sites to serve nearly 633,000 people.2\\n\\nPartnering to Boost Participation\\nGlobally, the number of young people donating \\nblood is on the decline. To address this trend, in \\n2015, we launched BE THE 1 — the first global \\nrecruitment movement focusing on expanding \\nthe pool of young donors. Since then, more than \\n100 blood and plasma centers have embraced \\nthe campaign and donations have increased as \\nmuch as 37% in certain countries. \\n\\n2 Figure is inclusive of all people served by the Abbott Fund, covering \\nhealth access, disaster relief and Future Well Kids.\\n3 https://www.diabetes.org/healthequitynow\\n\\nIn 2021, we launched “Give Blood. Get Back,” \\na campaign that reached more than 50 million \\npeople in the U.S. As part of this program, \\nwe engaged 15 influencers on TikTok and \\nInstagram, and included a licensed song \\nand TikTok dance challenge, achieving \\nunprecedented positive response and Gen Z/\\nMillennial engagement. Less than 48 hours \\nafter launch, more than 2,000 people accessed \\nthe website to find a location to donate with a \\n40% click-through rate.\\n\\nInclusive Clinical Trial Representation \\nWe believe data collected in clinical trials should \\nbe representative of the people our products \\nare intended to serve. But today, while people \\nof diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds \\nmake up nearly 40% of the U.S. population, and \\nare disproportionately impacted by chronic \\nconditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular \\ndisease, they are still heavily underrepresented \\nin the clinical trials process. To help address \\nthe disparities that exist in clinical trials, \\nwe’re developing an outreach plan to build \\ntrust in areas where trial participants haven’t \\ntraditionally been included. We want to work \\nwith others who recognize the need to overcome \\nfour substantial barriers to diverse participation \\nin clinical trials:\\n\\n• •  Lack of access to facilities, trials and/or \\n\\nresources in the area\\n\\n• •  Lack of understanding on the benefits to \\nself or community through participation\\n\\n• •  Lack of trust in institutions or individuals \\n\\ndue to prior bad experiences\\n\\n• •  Lack of clarity across languages\\n\\nPart of our outreach includes forming an \\nadvisory board, with the goal of determining \\nhow best to increase participation across gender \\nand ethnic lines. Some of the ways we plan to \\novercome these barriers and progress in this \\narea include:\\n\\n• •  Recruiting, training, developing and \\n\\ncoaching women and ethnically diverse \\ndoctors who reflect their communities and \\nare interested in clinical trials\\n\\n• •  Committing $5 million to fund nearly 300 \\n\\nscholarships through new partnerships \\nwith medical schools at Historically Black \\nColleges and Universities (HBCUs) and \\nminority nursing associations, with the goal \\nof producing more racially and ethnically \\ndiverse nurses and trialists who, if given the \\nopportunity, will dramatically impact trials \\nin the future\\n\\n• •  Expanding clinical trials into new \\nsites in more communities to reach \\nunderrepresented patients\\n\\n• •  Connecting with diverse participants and \\n\\ncultivating trust and education through the \\nuse of culturally appropriate materials\\n\\nBy expanding the reach of studies to include \\ndiverse groups, we can achieve a clearer \\nimage of our products’ impacts in real-world \\nsituations. Armed with this information, we can \\ncontinue to develop solutions that help even \\nmore people. \\n\\nWhen we initiated our LIFE-BTK study \\non a treatment for people with advanced \\nperipheral artery disease (PAD), we \\nestablished a diverse team of investigators \\nand performed trials across several locations \\nto reach underrepresented demographics. \\nPartnerships with institutes like the Women \\nas One physician organization helped further \\ndiversify the process. Similarly, our Beyond \\nIntervention research gathered insights from \\nover 1,800 people across 13 countries to create \\na more complete picture of how technology \\ncan improve the care of patients with \\nvascular disease. \\n\\nINCREASING ACCESS TO  \\nDIABETES CARE \\nThe Health Equity Bill of Rights\\xa0— \\nestablished by the American Diabetes \\nAssociation\\xa0— posits 10 basic rights for \\npeople with diabetes and prediabetes. \\nWe have sponsored a pilot initiative \\ndesigned by the association to address \\nright #9:\\nThe right to the latest medical advances\\nToday, Black Americans are 60%3 more \\nlikely to be diagnosed with diabetes, yet \\nmuch less likely to have their condition \\nwell managed. The goal of our three-\\nyear, $5\\xa0million effort is to reduce health \\ninequities by removing barriers to tools \\nand technology for diabetes management, \\nregardless of income level or insurance \\nstatus. The pilot seeks to better understand \\nand address the healthcare disparities for \\nBlack people living with diabetes.

For example, we have partnered with \\nthe Tanzanian government for more than \\n20 years to drive sustainable improvements \\nto the country’s healthcare system, delivering \\nemergency care to more than 1 million patients \\nto date.\\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nProactively Addressing Pandemic Threats \\nIn 2020, building on our decades-long \\nexperience in viral surveillance, we established \\nthe Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition to help \\nidentify new pathogens, analyze potential risk \\nlevels, develop and deploy diagnostic testing \\nand assess public health impacts. Throughout \\n2021, we expanded the coalition, leveraging \\nthe expertise of global centers of excellence \\nin laboratory testing, genetic sequencing \\nand public health research to respond to the \\nemergence of the COVID-19 Omicron variant. \\nFourteen cross-continent sites, including \\nAbbott, contributed to this research. \\n\\nWe partnered with The Task Force for Global \\nHealth on a first-of-its-kind field program to \\ntrain the next generation of epidemiologists. \\nAdditionally, a virology fellowship with the \\nGlobal Virus Network will help develop  \\nfuture virologists. \\n\\nImproving Outcomes With Ultreon \\nWe aim to improve outcomes for 1 million \\npatients annually using our Ultreon software to \\noptimize percutaneous coronary intervention \\n(PCI)4 by 2030. In 2021, we began the rollout \\nof Ultreon 1.0 software, which merges imaging \\ntechnology with artificial intelligence to \\nenhance visualization of PCI procedures. \\nThe software can automatically detect \\nblockage severity and measure blood vessel \\ncharacteristics, supporting more precise \\ndecisions. The game-changing capabilities \\nof this software resulted in Ultreon 1.0 \\nreceiving honoree recognition at the CES 2022 \\nInnovation Awards. \\n\\nUltreon 1.0 represents the first of several \\nsuch platforms. The data we’re collecting \\nfrom it are already informing development of \\nUltreon\\xa02.0 — a system that will be accessible \\nto smaller centers, improving outcomes for a \\ngrowing number of patients. \\n\\nSCORING BIG FOR KIDS’ HEALTH\\nIn 2021, we entered into a three-year agreement to be the Health Sciences and \\nNutrition Partner for Real Madrid Football Club. We have also signed on as Global \\nPartner of the Real Madrid Foundation\\xa0— an organization founded by the club to \\npromote the value of sport to children globally. \\nThe partnership will deliver education, sports and social welfare activities to support \\nchildren in under-resourced communities in 80 countries. It will also involve working \\nwith Real Madrid Foundation social sports schools in 12 countries to provide malnutrition \\nscreening, education and nutrition support. Finally, through the agreement,  \\nwe will address nutrition needs through Real Madrid Foundation clinics, which  \\nare hosted in 42 countries.\\n\\n4 PCI is a minimally invasive procedure used to open coronary arteries \\nand restore blood flow. \\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nPricing Discipline to Improve Access\\n\\nHealthcare products are a valuable \\nsocietal investment\\xa0— they enable \\npeople and societies to flourish. We are \\ncommitted to finding innovative ways to \\nimprove efficiency and consumer access \\nto our life-changing products. \\n\\nAffordable Diagnostics \\nOur diagnostics business is always on \\nthe lookout for ways to improve costs by \\nincreasing efficiency in our manufacturing, \\nsupply chain and product support areas. Over \\nthe past four years, we have realized year-over-\\nyear improvements in cost of goods for more \\nthan 80% of products by volume. \\n\\nCost Savings Fund Innovation\\nThroughout 2021, our sites took several steps \\nto improve operational efficiency, resulting in \\ncost savings that help drive our investment in \\ninnovation. For example:\\n\\n• •  In Africa, we launched malaria diagnostic \\ntests with smaller packaging dimensions, \\nreducing required distribution trips and \\nlowering logistics costs by around 28% for \\ncustomers. We also increased accessibility of \\nthese products and helped ensure continuity \\nof supply by combining the supply \\ncapabilities of our manufacturing facility in \\nChina with those of our site in Korea. \\n\\n• •  Additionally, we completed a regulatory \\n\\nsubmission for small-pack HIV diagnostic \\ntests. The suggested reduction in kit \\nbox dimensions will translate into \\napproximately 50% logistics cost savings \\nfor customers as a result of improved \\nshipping efficiency. \\n\\n• •  To enable affordability for the governments \\n\\nand agencies purchasing our Panbio \\nCOVID-19 Antigen Self-Test, we have \\nimproved materials and labor efficiency \\nand have achieved a 32% decrease in \\nmanufacturing costs.\\n\\nAdditionally, the launch of a new diagnostic \\nproduct for traumatic brain injury (TBI) — \\nthe i-STAT Alinity TBI Plasma — will enable \\nconcussion diagnoses through blood tests. \\nThis will reduce the need for expensive \\nCT scans, bringing down overall healthcare \\ncosts following head injuries. \\n\\nVALUE EMBEDDED BY DESIGN \\nOne of Abbott’s Core Design Principles is \\nto optimize the products we create across \\nfour factors: people reached, consumer \\nbenefit, business and societal value. Doing so \\nstarts with understanding the needs of our \\ncustomers\\xa0— from patients and healthcare \\nprofessionals to policymakers and those who \\nfund developments. \\nAn important example of this principle in action \\ncan be found in the Early Value Assessment \\n(EVA) process. Through this process, we help \\nensure the expectations of key stakeholders \\nare upheld even as we target increased access \\nand\\xa0affordability.\\nThrough the EVA, we proactively identify \\nsteps that will drive economic and clinical value \\nfor future products. Recommendations are \\nthen captured during design and development \\nprocesses; in turn, positively impacting future \\nreimbursement, coverage and access for patients.\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nInfrastructure and Transforming \\nStandards of Care \\n\\nWe are building infrastructure, offering \\ntraining and providing resources to \\nhelp decentralize care and transform \\nhealthcare standards in communities \\naround the world. \\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nIn 2021, we extended support to 32 \\nhealthcare centers, including training 2,851 \\nhealthcare workers on decentralized services. \\nWe provided over 705,000 people with \\ndecentralized services globally. \\n\\nThe Abbott Center for  \\nMalnutrition Solutions \\nThe Abbott Center for Malnutrition \\nSolutions — our cross-functional innovation \\nhub — is working to improve identification, \\ntreatment and prevention of malnutrition. \\nExternal partnerships, research, innovation \\nand financial support also contribute to \\ndeveloping accessible, sustainable and locally \\nrelevant options for those most in need. \\n\\nAddressing Gaps in Care \\nIn 2019, we began working with the Rwandan \\nMinistry of Health and the Society for Family \\nHealth Rwanda to build an independent, \\ndecentralized and financially stable health \\nnetwork. Together, we launched second-\\ngeneration health posts to address gaps \\nin primary care and testing for HIV and \\nother infectious diseases, including malaria. \\nThrough December 2021, these posts have \\ntreated approximately 260,000 people.\\n\\nIn certain areas, where the closest existing \\nfacilities were up to three hours away, health \\nposts have increased access to care eightfold \\nand cut travel times to around 17 minutes. \\nSince inception, malaria screenings have risen \\nby 68%, with 21,000 residents treated for \\npositive cases.\\n\\nA recent study determined that most of the \\ncare provided during visits to these posts \\nwould not have occurred without them. The \\nhealth post’s main benefit was a substantial \\nincrease in the use of curative primary care for \\nconditions such as malaria, intestinal parasites \\n\\nand acute respiratory infections. These health \\nposts are also financially stable and will be able \\nto sustainably provide care for local residents. \\nDuring their second year of operation, these \\nposts generated an economic profit of 29%. \\n\\nThe study also demonstrated that access to \\nthese health posts addressed a high demand \\nfor these services in rural Rwanda. As a means \\nto improving the health of Rwanda’s rural \\npopulation, these facilities are both improving \\nequity within Rwanda and providing a \\nroadmap for doing the same globally.\\n\\nTransforming Virus Research  \\nwith Biomarkers \\nWe have launched a hepatitis B virus (HBV) \\nbiomarker program to expand understanding \\nof, and treatment for, patients with chronic \\nHBV. Using HBV RNA and surface antigen \\ntests, we are conducting studies to inform \\nmore effective treatments. While research is \\nongoing, evidence for the value of biomarkers \\nin moderating patient care has already been \\nshared in 14 publications. \\n\\nDIAGNOSTIC PANELS FOR \\nENHANCED\\xa0TREATMENT\\nA diagnostic panel is a predetermined \\ngroup of medical tests used in the diagnosis \\nand treatment of disease. Panels support \\ndevelopment of more effective treatments.  \\nIn 2021, we launched, or set the groundwork  \\nfor, three targeted panels. \\n• • \\n\\n Antenatal Care (ANC) Panel: established  \\nto improve lives and reduce mortality for  \\nthe 20 million mothers and children in high-\\nburden countries through regular screening \\nand infection hotspot maps. It supports the \\nWorld Health Organization’s mission to \\neliminate mother-to-child transmission of \\nHIV, HBV and syphilis by\\xa02030.\\n Malnutrition Panel: research is underway to \\nimprove well-being for children and pregnant \\nwomen, using biomarkers to identify \\nmicronutrient deficiencies via clinical and  \\nat-home tests. Development of this panel  \\nwill continue into 2022 and beyond.\\n\\n• • \\n\\n• •  Fever Panel: development has started to \\n\\nunderstand how biomarkers can help clinicians \\nbetter identify root causes of fever, enabling \\nproper treatment and care. This will be \\nparticularly important in pregnant women \\nand young children. It will also aid infection \\nidentification in patients with fever-like and \\nother “generic” symptoms.\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nDRIVING DIABETES CARE IN \\nUNDERINVESTED COMMUNITIES \\nIn 2019, the Abbott Fund launched our  \\nFuture Well Communities program in Stockton, \\nCalifornia, to address health disparities by \\nremoving barriers that prevent people with \\ndiabetes from living a healthy life.

This includes \\nincreasing NCD screening, providing health \\neducation, monitoring and referral services, \\nand building capacity and awareness on \\nprevention and control. Abbott has also been \\ndonating rapid-testing technology, diabetes \\nmonitors and test strips.\\n\\nThe results are encouraging. Following \\ntargeted interventions, patients with \\ncontrolled blood sugar levels rose to 59.1%, up \\nfrom 50.8% at baseline, and more than 65% of \\npatients improved their fasting glucose level, \\nwhich is important to reducing overall risks of \\nrelated health complications.\\n\\nNATURAL DISASTER RELIEF \\nFor 16 years, we have been partnering with \\nFeeding America and Direct Relief to prepare \\ncommunities for hurricane season. Critically \\nneeded supplies, including rehydration \\nsolutions and nutrition products, are \\ndistributed to food banks and health clinics \\nacross high-risk areas in the U.S. and Puerto \\nRico. In 2021, these programs supported more \\nthan 12,000 people. Last year, we broadened \\nthese efforts, implementing a disaster \\nresilience strategy to help prevent and mitigate \\nnegative impacts on communities in New \\nOrleans, Dallas, Orlando and Puerto Rico. \\n\\nWe are committed to rapid response following \\nnatural disasters and other emergencies. In \\n2021, Abbott and the Abbott Fund donated \\napproximately $2 million in cash and product \\nto address immediate needs and long-term \\nrecovery efforts. This included providing relief \\nfollowing flooding in China, Germany, Turkey \\nand the U.S.; earthquakes in Croatia and Haiti; \\nwildfires in Turkey; hurricanes in the U.S.; and \\nsupport for Afghan refugees in the U.S.\\n\\nWhen communities thrive, we all thrive. \\nAbbott has a long-standing history of \\ncontributing expertise, product, cash and \\ntime to help support our communities. \\n\\nTACKLING NON-\\nCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES\\nOur Future Well initiatives help drive progress \\nagainst noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).

The results give us a \\nstronger view of our capabilities and will help \\ndrive continuous improvement initiatives. We \\nalso produced new data privacy principles, \\neffective as of January 1, 2022, to make our \\nposition on information collection, data use and \\nsharing, and security clear and publicly available. \\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH\\nTo provide personalized treatments we must \\ndraw on patient and customer insights. To \\naddress potential privacy risks, we develop \\nour products, processes and internal systems \\n\\nsecurely, embedding data safety considerations \\nin everything we do. We comply with local \\nregulations for reporting and notification \\nof security breaches involving customers’ \\npersonal information in all locations where \\nAbbott operates.\\n\\nWe transitioned our global privacy program \\nto a centralized system in 2018, to drive a \\nconsistent approach across Abbott. Our Global \\nPrivacy Office — part of our Office of Ethics and \\nCompliance (OEC) — is overseen by the Chief \\nEthics and Compliance Officer and the Divisional \\nVice President for Global Privacy. Dedicated \\nglobal professionals, as well as country-specific \\nprivacy champions, identify and address data \\nprivacy matters. Clear standards, processes and \\ntraining develop employee understanding of how \\nto protect sensitive information, making data \\nprivacy a shared responsibility. \\n\\nOversight Committees \\nIn addition to the Global Privacy Office, \\nwe have two oversight committees that \\nconnect with key stakeholders across Abbott. \\n\\nEach oversight committee also has its own \\noperational committees that engage at a \\nproduct and business-unit level. \\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Privacy Oversight \\nCommittee brings together officers from Legal, \\nOEC, Finance, Human Resources, Quality and \\nInformation Technology. Its role is to provide \\noversight to senior management on Abbott’s \\ncybersecurity and privacy programs, and to \\nadvise on and monitor strategies. The Product \\nSecurity Oversight Committee, established \\nin January 2020, comprises corporate and \\ndivision senior leadership across Abbott. The \\ncommittee meets quarterly to develop our \\nstrategy and approach to product security, \\nmonitoring progress and supporting company-\\nwide compliance. \\n\\nIn addition, Abbott’s senior cybersecurity and \\nprivacy leaders provide regular updates to the \\nBoard of Directors and Board Committees, \\nproviding progress updates, sharing \\nopportunities for improvement and embedding \\ndata protection and cybersecurity into the top \\nlevels of governance.\\n\\nKEEPING PATIENTS AND DOCTORS CONNECTED  \\nDURING COVID-19\\nWe envision a world where data to inform better health choices is right at our \\nfingertips.

There are also \\nregional cybersecurity leaders deployed in \\nstrategic geographies around the world for local \\nsupport. This organization is led by Abbott’s \\nChief Information Security Officer (CISO). \\n\\nOur Product cybersecurity organization is \\nfocused on driving cybersecurity standards \\nthroughout the total product life cycle. At the \\ncorporate level, we provide shared services \\nto our business units such as inventory \\nand vulnerability management to leverage \\neconomies of scale. Our divisions and product \\nteams also have cybersecurity expertise, \\nensuring that our products and medical devices \\nare secure by design. Our Cybersecurity and \\nQuality organizations partner to incorporate \\ncybersecurity throughout the total product life \\ncycle, from design to the integrity of quality data \\nsystems. This organization is led by Abbott’s \\nDivisional Vice President of Product Security. \\n\\nBoth cybersecurity leaders report to Abbott’s \\nChief Information Officer (CIO), who has overall \\nresponsibility. Our CIO reports directly to our \\nChief Financial Officer (CFO), who in turn \\nreports to our Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\\n\\nEnterprise Cybersecurity \\nPhishing attacks and social engineering scams \\nare among the largest cybersecurity threats. \\nOne of the most important objectives of this \\norganization is creating a security-focused \\nculture and providing our employees clear \\ndirection on security controls necessary to \\nprotect operations.

We engage \\nwith candidates to provide all the information \\nthey need to succeed during interviews — \\nincluding offering them access to our Abbott \\nTalent Community — and maintain ongoing \\nconnections with them through our social \\nchannels. This way, we can build a pipeline of \\nqualified, interested candidates that we can \\nconsider for future opportunities. \\n\\n5 In previous years, we reported on our corporate-sponsored training \\nonly. Due to enhancement in data collection, we are including trainings \\nconducted by our businesses in this submission; these programs were \\nnot previously reported. Hence, our results are significantly higher \\nthan in 2020. \\n\\nIn addition, we engage organizations such as \\nAdvancing Minorities’ Interest in Engineering \\n(AMIE) and the Society of Women Engineers \\nto identify diverse talent. Partnerships with \\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities \\n(HBCUs) institutions like Howard University \\nand North Carolina Agricultural and Technical \\nState University also support our future \\nemployee pipeline. \\n\\nOur career site employs artificial intelligence \\nto enhance the application process, \\nstreamlining user experiences with tailored \\ncontent and a personalized chatbot to help \\nidentify roles. In 2021, Abbott filled 26,184 \\npositions, and 15% of all open positions were \\nfilled by internal candidates. \\n\\nDeveloping Employees\\nIn addition to attracting new employees, we \\nare committed to developing and retaining our \\ncurrent employees. Through our many programs \\nand resources, we provide opportunities for \\nindividual growth and development, helping \\nemployees build great long-term careers at \\nAbbott. We value our experienced employees; \\ntheir knowledge helps us succeed as a company \\nand contributes to a strong succession pipeline. \\nSome of the resources that help our employees \\nprogress include: \\n\\n• •  Ongoing reviews, career development \\n\\ndiscussions and goal setting with managers \\n\\n• •  Access to Career Connect — our personalized \\n\\ncareer development and planning tool\\n\\n• •  Mentoring, job-specific education  \\n\\nand leadership training \\n\\n• •  Annual performance management processes \\n\\nOur Board of Directors conducts an annual \\nTalent Management Review (TMR) to \\nreview critical position succession plans and \\ndevelopment actions. TMRs are also held at \\ndivisional, functional, country, region and \\nteam levels to find Ready Now and Ready \\nFuture successors, and to support intentional \\ndevelopment plans for them. Included in these \\ndiscussions is the identification of early career \\ntalent with leadership potential. \\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nLearning Opportunities \\nWe offer many employee development \\nopportunities, working to bring more online \\neach year. Throughout 2021, we delivered \\nan average of 28 hours of training and \\ndevelopment per full-time employee (FTE).5 \\nThis equated to an average training and \\ndevelopment spend of $227 per FTE. \\n\\nAlso in 2021, Abbott launched a comprehensive \\nleadership training program called Leading \\nWith Impact (LWI) for over 18,000 people \\nmanagers worldwide. LWI provides 12 weeks \\nof self-paced, virtually delivered, immediately \\napplicable coaching and training.\\n\\nBy the end of 2021, 17,375 people managers \\nhad participated. Through the program, they \\ngained new skills, tools and perspectives to \\nhelp them create a more supportive, inclusive \\nand rewarding environment for their teams.\\n\\nIndustry-Leading Internships \\nInternships offer future innovators first-\\nhand industry experience. Throughout 2021, \\nwe expanded our IT and Computer Science \\ninternship in the U.S., with plans underway to \\nbring our Engineering co-op program to more \\napplicants.

We want to create \\nan environment that nurtures everyone, \\nregardless of race, gender, age, sexual \\norientation, disability or nationality.\\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nWe are creating a culture where inclusiveness \\nis a natural state, not an initiative. We want \\nit to be the natural way things get done at \\nAbbott. It takes all of us to build and maintain \\nthe just and inclusive culture we want to live \\nand work in. To help build engagement, we’ve \\ninitiated a program of “Let’s Talk” sessions, in \\nwhich employees engage in open and honest \\ndiscussions about diversity and inclusion.\\n\\nWe are increasing representation of \\nunderrepresented groups throughout \\nAbbott. Our Executive Diversity Council \\nconsists of diverse leaders who demonstrate \\ntheir commitment to diversity and \\ninclusion. Members are selected based on \\ncharacteristics and qualities that highlight \\ntheir desire to champion and drive diversity \\nand inclusion and span across the enterprise.\\n\\nThe council meets several times a year to \\ndiscuss key successes related to diversity and \\ninclusion in the current year, and establish \\nclear priorities for the future. The council \\ncan serve as an ad hoc advisor on new \\nprograms proposed to maximize inclusion \\nat Abbott, and holds a formal responsibility \\nfor supporting the diversity and inclusion \\nstrategy development, ensuring diversity \\nand inclusion practices are integrated into \\nbusiness practices/strategy, and program \\nimplementation at Abbott.\\n\\nCommunities of Support \\nEmployee networks bring underrepresented \\nemployees (and their allies) together to share \\nexperiences, expand visibility and create \\nopportunities. Almost 15,000 members benefit \\nfrom the activities and programs our employee \\nnetwork groups support.

Employees may also be invited to share \\ntheir views through onboarding and “stay” \\nsurveys, sponsored by our businesses and \\nregional/country affiliates.\\n\\nWe maintain several other channels to \\ngather thoughts. Our Chairman and CEO \\nregularly communicates with employees \\nthrough various channels, including email \\nand video, and invites their responses. He \\nalso holds an annual All Employee meeting \\nthat provides an opportunity for employees \\nto pose questions and comments. Our senior \\nleaders also respond to employee comments \\nand concerns at small-group and town-hall-\\nstyle meetings. Finally, our employee networks \\nhave created a host of additional forums for \\nemployees to voice opinions, concerns and \\nrecommendations for improvements. \\n\\nMichelle Spencer, Senior Manager, Sales \\nOperations in Abbott’s Nutrition business, was \\nhonored by our Black Business Network for her \\ninspiring leadership within the organization.\\n\\n32\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nMaking Abbott an actively inclusive \\ncommunity is one of our top priorities. In 2021, \\nwe launched our inaugural Diversity, Equity & \\nInclusion report setting out our action plan. \\n\\nWe’re actively working to increase the number \\nof women in our leadership ranks and across \\nour many STEM roles. The annual Society \\nof Women Engineers conference offers an \\nopportunity to connect with the brightest \\nfemale minds in the industry. \\n\\nIn 2021, we nominated seven inspiring Abbott \\nwomen for inclusion in the Women of Color \\nin STEM Peer Review award. We were proud \\nthat Deborah Brown — our Senior Director \\nof Toxicology — received an award for \\nManagerial Leadership.  \\n\\nAlso in 2021, we received a number of awards \\nand honors for our performance, including:\\n\\n• •  DiversityInc’s Top 50 Companies for \\n\\nDiversity (18 straight years in 2021)\\n\\n• •  2021 Seramount Inclusion Index\\n\\n• •  2021 Seramount Best Companies for \\n\\nMulticultural Women\\n\\nEthnic Representation in U.S. Management Positions (totals by race)\\nWhite\\nUnderrepresented \\ngroups\\n\\n67%\\n33%\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWorkplace Gender Diversity, U.S. \\nOur continued focus has helped us maintain or improve our gender diversity \\nmeasures across the board, and we take particular pride in the progress we’ve \\nmade increasing our percentage of management positions held by women.\\n\\nFemale share of workforce\\n2021\\n2020\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTotal management positions filled by women\\n2021\\n2020\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWomen in STEM-related positions\\n2021\\n2020\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWorkplace Gender Diversity, Global \\nFemale share of workforce\\n2021\\n2020\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTotal management positions filled by women\\n2021\\n2020\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWomen in STEM-related positions\\n2021\\n2020\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n47%\\n47%\\n\\n43%\\n32%\\n\\n43%\\n42%\\n\\n45%\\n45%\\n\\n40%\\n39%\\n\\n44.6%\\n44%\\n\\nNurturing Diversity in STEM\\nOur High School STEM internship \\nprogram supports female and \\nminority students making their first \\nsteps into STEM fields.

By supporting \\nlocal causes, our employees bring to life \\nAbbott’s purpose to help more people \\nthan ever achieve better health. \\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nCaring has always been one of our core values. \\nOur Employee Giving Program and volunteering \\noptions create spaces for employees to uphold \\nthis legacy of care in their communities. \\nOversight for community engagement sits \\nwith our Citizenship organization, including \\nemployee giving and volunteering, as well as \\nprograms and strategies for product donations. \\n\\nEmployee Donations and Matched Giving \\nIn 2021, we introduced our enhanced \\nEmployee Giving Program in the U.S. and \\nPuerto Rico. The program brings together \\nour existing Employee Giving Campaign and \\n\\nAbbott Fund Matching Grant Program into  \\none integrated donation program. \\n\\nThrough the new Employee Giving Program, the \\nAbbott Fund has expanded its guidelines, making \\nmore nonprofit organizations eligible for matched \\ndonations, and doubling its match to 100% of \\neligible donations, up from 50% previously. And, \\nso every cent goes to the charity of choice, Abbott \\ncommits to paying all processing fees. \\n\\nEmployee Volunteering \\nWe provide employees with a range of \\nopportunities for local volunteering. Most \\nrecently, we honored the legacy of Martin Luther \\nKing Jr. by continuing to offer U.S. employees \\neight hours of paid time to volunteer — at any \\ntime during the year — in their community in \\nways that are meaningful for them.\\n\\nOur employees are passionate about making a \\ndifference in our industry as well, and know that \\nto create the healthcare innovators of tomorrow, \\nwe must inspire young people today. We \\nmaintain partnerships with schools, educational \\norganizations and nonprofits to promote \\nengagement in STEM. \\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nThrough our enhanced Employee Giving \\nProgram, which launched in September \\n2021, employees can donate year-round to \\norganizations they care about. Included in \\nthis is our Employee Giving Campaign, an \\nannual donation drive run every October for \\nover 40 years. During the 2021 campaign, \\n95% of employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico \\npledged over $15 million6 to more than 9,500 \\ncharitable organizations in a single month — a \\nclear indicator of their passion for making \\na difference.\\n\\n2021 Social Investing\\n\\nCash contributions\\nIn-kind giving, product or \\nservice\\xa0donations\\nAdministrative costs\\n\\nTime, employee volunteering \\n\\nTotal\\n\\n$48,311,612\\n\\n$35,961,192\\n\\n $5,120,420\\n\\n$736,774\\n\\n$90,129,998\\n\\n6 This figure includes employee donations and Abbott Fund donation \\nmatches.

We are committed to equal pay for \\nequal work, and do not tolerate discrimination \\nin pay, as stated in our position statement \\non human rights. Three concepts guide \\ndevelopment of consistent, fair compensation: \\n\\n• •  Base salaries and benefits are based on, \\n\\nand competitive in, the markets where we \\ncompete for talent\\n\\n• •  Annual and long-term incentives are linked \\n\\nto business and individual performance, \\nwith a balance of short- and long-term \\nfinancial and strategic objectives \\n\\n• •  Compensation encourages behavior \\nconsistent with the ethical values in \\nAbbott’s Code of Business Conduct \\n\\nOur leadership covenant specifically states \\nthat senior leaders are accountable for the \\nachievement of Abbott’s 2030 Sustainability \\nPlan goals. Any corporate officer that does not \\nfulfill the covenant can receive a reduction of \\nup to 100% of their annual incentive and/or \\nlong-term incentive awards.\\n\\nA Stake in Abbott7 \\nHelping employees build an ownership stake \\nin Abbott is key to our philosophy. Several \\nprograms facilitate this: \\n\\n• •  Global long-term incentive program: \\ngrants restricted stock units (RSUs) to \\nemployees, generally beginning at the \\nmanager level. Paid out in shares of Abbott \\ncommon stock (except in countries that \\nrequire cash payment). \\n\\n• •  401(k) program: offers employees in \\n\\nthe U.S. and Puerto Rico a 5% match for \\nemployee contributions of 2% or more. \\nEmployees can choose from a range of \\ninvestments, including company stock. \\n\\n• •  Employees Stock Purchase Plan: offers \\nemployees (excluding corporate officers) \\nin most countries outside the U.S. stock at a \\ndiscounted price.\\n\\n7 Eligibility for nonsalary benefits follows local regulations and practices. In most countries, this means we offer benefits to full-time employees \\nand part-time employees working more than a certain number of hours. Outside the U.S., we typically provide benefit programs above and beyond \\ngovernment requirements.\\n8 Full-time, permanent employees with loans under the Dutch student loan system implemented in 2015.\\n\\nEnabling Financial Freedom\\nOur first-of-its-kind Freedom 2 Save program \\nhelps U.S. employees save for retirement while \\nrepaying student loans. Employees who put \\nat least 2% of eligible pay toward repayments \\nreceive a 5% 401(k) contribution from Abbott. \\nMore than 1,400 employees have enrolled, \\nwith Abbott contributing over $3.5 million \\ndollars to their accounts. \\n\\nFor retirement-eligible employees, Freedom to \\nWork supports reduced schedules, workloads \\nand/or responsibilities while allowing employees \\nto continue building retirement income. Over \\n1,800 employees have enrolled since 2008.\\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nIn 2021, Abbott granted RSUs to 13,199 \\nemployees across 71 countries, while more than \\n18,000 employees in 60 countries participated \\nin our Employees Stock Purchase Plan. \\n\\nSupporting Financial Independence \\nA new college loan repayment program in the \\nNetherlands is helping more employees achieve \\nfinancial independence. Eligible employees8 \\ncan receive reimbursement from Abbott of \\n¤1,200 annually, up to a total of 50% of post-\\ngraduation balance. \\n\\nEnabling Further Education with FreeU\\nWe know financial considerations can \\nrepresent a barrier to further education. \\nIn 2021, we launched FreeU that, when \\ncombined with our tuition reimbursement \\nprogram, enables employees to pursue a \\nbachelor’s degree at no personal cost. This \\nprogram underscores Abbott’s commitment \\nto\\xa0— and belief in\\xa0— developing our people \\nso they can pursue rewarding careers.\\nAbbott pays the full cost of required starting \\ncoursework. Credits are then automatically \\ntransferred to a participating online \\nuniversity where employees can complete \\ntheir studies. \\nEmployees have access to free classes on \\ntopics like time management and study skills \\nplus 10 hours of personal tutoring annually. \\nSuccess coaches support participants to plan \\nand achieve academic goals while access to \\nMyTimeEnglish helps non-native English \\nspeakers develop the language skills needed \\nto complete assignments. \\n137 people enrolled in the FreeU program in \\nthe six months that followed its launch.\\n\\nAnthony Ashford is pursuing a degree in \\nbusiness management with the support of \\nAbbott’s FreeU program.\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nEmployee Well-Being\\n\\nEmployee well-being matters, and we are \\nfully committed to protecting it. We offer \\nprograms that support work–life harmony \\nand promote good health, with many \\navailable to employees’ families as well.\\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nWe recognize that, to feel and perform \\nat their best, employees must be able to \\nbalance work and family responsibilities. \\nDuring the pandemic, we recognized that \\nthe way we work was going to change. So, \\nbuilding upon our long-standing practice of \\nflexibility, we made changes to support these \\ntrends, offering eligible employees enhanced \\nopportunities to benefit from options like \\nflextime, compressed work weeks, reduced \\nschedules, job sharing and remote working. \\nWe also made changes to our U.S. vacation \\npolicy to offer employees more weeks of paid \\ntime off earlier in their careers.\\n\\nIn the U.S., on-site child care, discounts \\non external child care, and parenting and \\ncounseling services are provided. New \\nparents are offered eight weeks’ paid leave, \\nand since 2015, we have given financial \\nsupport for adoption of up to $20,000 \\nper child. \\n\\nOur company-funded Employee Assistance \\nProgram (EAP) provides free expert mental \\nhealth support for employees and their \\nfamilies through one-on-one assistance, \\nseminars, online courses, crisis intervention \\nservices and workplace emergency response. \\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nSupporting Every Employee\\nWe want as many of our people as possible \\nto benefit from well-being services. In 2021, \\nwe expanded our EAP to the Czech Republic, \\nSlovakia, South Africa and Vietnam, reaching \\nmore employees with mental health support. \\nThis builds on the more than 20 countries we \\nintroduced the EAP to in 2020 and brings  \\nthe total program presence to more than  \\n50 countries.\\n\\nThousands of employees participated in \\nwellness sessions, including a webinar \\non reducing stress, overcoming burnout, \\nenhancing relationships and creating work–\\nlife balance, and a live meditation session. In \\nhonor of World Mental Health Day in October, \\nwe offered employees across the world three \\nmental health awareness webinars.\\n\\nIn India, the second wave of COVID-19 \\npresented a difficult situation with the average \\ndaily case numbers peaking above 300,000. \\nThis led to a scarcity of oxygen, medicines, \\nhospital beds, ventilators and access to \\ndoctors and a medical infrastructure stretched \\nbeyond capacity. Our team in India mobilized \\nresources to build a regional task force and \\na comprehensive program for employees \\nand their families. They delivered support \\nto employees that included telemedicine \\nand home COVID-19 management; robust \\nemployee communications and support; \\noxygen concentrators for employee usage and \\nvaccinations for all employees.\\n\\nA Globally Recognized Commitment to Our Employees\\nWe prioritize well-being because we care about our employees. \\nWhile\\xa0not motivated by external recognition, we are proud \\nto have been featured in several global indices for our efforts \\nthroughout\\xa02021. \\n• •  Great Place to Work certified  \\n(U.S., U.K., Brazil, Costa Rica)\\n Fortune Best Workplaces in Health Care and Best Big \\nCompanies to Work For\\n\\n• • \\n\\n• •  Seramount 100 Best Company\\n• •  Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption Best Adoption-\\n\\nFriendly\\xa0Workplace\\n\\n• •  Science magazine Top Employer\\n• •  Certified Top Employer by Top Employers Institute  \\n\\nin six EU\\xa0and\\xa0three Middle East countries\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nEmployee Health and Safety\\n\\nThe health and safety of our employees and \\ncontract workers is paramount for Abbott. \\nThrough an integrated Environment, \\nHealth and Safety (EHS) management \\nsystem and a dedicated EHS Leadership \\nCouncil, we are embedding a culture of \\nsafety across every area of our business.\\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nOur EHS Leadership Council governs the \\nEHS organization. It comprises professionals \\nwho manage internal programs across \\n90 manufacturing sites, and commercial \\nprofessionals who support field-based \\nteams, offices and warehouses in more \\nthan 90 countries. The commercial EHS \\norganization is divided across six regions, \\neach with a dedicated manager. At each \\nAbbott site, designated safety representatives \\nand safety teams help ensure the successful \\nimplementation of our internal programs.\\n\\nWe maintain global policies and standards  \\nfor managing employee health and safety. \\nExperts regularly update these to reflect \\nchanges in regulations and global expectations. \\nSimilar standards extend to contractors \\n\\nworking at Abbott locations. Each site \\nmust comply with robust contractor EHS \\nmanagement programs, including: \\n\\n• •  Training for Abbott employees responsible \\n\\nfor contractor activities\\n\\n• •  An EHS approval process for \\n\\ncontractor companies \\n\\n• •  Orientations for contractor employees\\n\\n• •  EHS plans for projects over $2 million\\n\\n• •  A full-time safety representative on large \\n\\nconstruction projects \\n\\n• •  Inspections of contractor activity\\n\\n• •  Contractor completion of Job Hazard \\n\\nAnalyses or Risk Assessment and \\nMethod Statements \\n\\n• •  Evaluation of contractor company’s \\n\\nEHS performance \\n\\nWe regularly evaluate commercial operations, \\nmanufacturing and research and development \\n(R&D) sites through internal compliance \\nassurance audits that cover: \\n\\n• •  Health and safety \\n\\n• •  Strategic planning and prioritization \\n\\n• •  Risk assessment/self-assessment \\n\\n• •  Business integration \\n\\n• •  Training and awareness \\n\\n• •  Communication and information \\n\\n• •  Performance measures \\n\\nSenior leadership uses EHS scorecards to \\nmonitor performance. We communicate results \\nacross our organization, identifying necessary \\ncorrective actions and ensuring actions are \\ncompleted on time. A separate Global Health \\nScorecard is used by site and divisional leaders \\nto track implementation of occupational health \\nand well-being initiatives. Each site is required \\nto improve its score annually. \\n\\nOccupational Health Services \\nOur global Occupational Health Services \\n(OHS) team — part of the EHS organization — \\ndevelops and maintains occupational health \\n(OH) policies, procedures and guidelines, trains \\nrelevant employees and consults on regulatory \\ncompliance. Together with the EHS team, they \\nlead our response to public health emergencies \\nwith the potential to impact our business, such \\nas the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nThis team is also responsible for implementing \\nour global employee health and productivity \\nstrategy, tracking progress against key \\nperformance indicators (KPIs) and identifying \\nimprovement opportunities. To support this, \\nwe have developed our Occupational Health \\nServices Standard, requiring facilities to \\nprovide adequate resources and designated \\nhealthcare professionals with site-specific \\nknowledge. Today, over 130 OH professionals \\nsupport employee health and well-being, treat \\nillnesses and injuries, and maintain employee \\nmedical records. They conduct regular \\nscreenings and health education programs to \\nidentify and minimize occupational risks. \\n\\nOur Reproductive Hazard Management \\nStandard ensures the health and safety of \\nemployees and their potential future children. \\nWe also use established external standards \\nand certifications to drive continuous \\nimprovement. At the end of 2021, 22 \\nAbbott sites were certified to International \\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) 45001.\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nFostering a Health and Safety Culture \\nTo build a robust health and safety culture, we \\nmust engage everyone at Abbott — something \\nwe achieve and maintain through our EHS \\npolicy and several technical and management \\nstandards, including: \\n\\n• •  Risk Assessment and Self-Assessment \\nManagement Standard: requirements  \\nfor assessing and mitigating health and \\nsafety risks \\n\\n• •  Training and Awareness Management \\nStandard: requirements for employees to \\nbe aware of health and safety risks and have \\nknowledge of job-specific hazards\\n\\n• •  Area-specific technical standards:  \\n\\ne.g., Fleet Safety, Control of Hazardous \\nEnergy, Confined Spaces, Ergonomics, \\nElectrical Safety, Biological Safety and \\nWorking at Heights \\n\\n• •  Emergency Preparedness Standard: \\n\\nrequirements for emergency preparedness \\nplanning and minimum requirements to \\nensure health and safety on-site and in \\nsurrounding communities.

However, each division also \\nimplemented initiatives to drive improvement. \\nThese include ongoing driver safety initiatives \\nand multiple ergonomic projects. Our 2021 lost-\\ntime case rate has remained consistent with what \\nwe achieved in 2020, even as operational activity \\nand on-site working returned to pre-pandemic \\nlevels at certain facilities. We are also happy \\nto report that Abbott experienced no fatalities \\namong our employees or contractors in 2021.\\n\\nIncreasingly Robust Standards\\nOur teams have worked to increase \\nunderstanding of workplace health and safety \\nissues, updating our protocols to safeguard \\nagainst occupational injuries and illness. We \\nrefreshed our internal ergonomic technical \\nstandard to more thoroughly address \\nthe leading causes of illness and injuries. \\nAdditionally, increased focus was placed on \\ncreating a global task force on lockout/tagout \\ncontrol of hazardous energy, a step that will \\nhelp ensure enhanced safety procedures are \\nfollowed when servicing machinery. \\n\\nA Global Safe-Driving Program\\nOur safe-driving program reduces vehicle \\naccidents across Abbott. In Latin America, \\na new driver risk assessment covers driver \\nprofile, driving behaviors and knowledge of \\nlocal traffic regulations. This information will \\nhelp us develop trainings targeted to drivers’ \\nspecific risk level. In India, our commercial \\nEHS team is developing a vehicle safety \\ninitiative focused on two-wheelers to reduce \\ncrash-related injuries.\\n\\nContinuing to Keep People Healthy  \\nDuring COVID-19\\nThroughout 2021, we have maintained robust \\non-site cleaning procedures and continued to \\nprovide personal protective equipment (PPE) \\n\\nto those who require it. To keep employees \\nhealthy we offered on-site testing and vaccine \\nclinics in certain locations. \\n\\nIn the U.S., we regularly test employees and \\ncontractors directly involved in manufacturing \\nour COVID-19 tests, and have expanded this \\ntesting to other facilities and offices across \\nthe U.S. and at our facilities in other countries \\nas well. This ambitious employee testing \\nprogram has resulted in more than 3 million \\ntests performed globally since the start of the \\nemployee and contractor testing. We have also \\ndeveloped guidelines on traveling, returning \\nto work and case management to reduce \\ntransmission risks.\\n\\nWhile social distancing, wearing a mask, \\nfrequent hand washing, and asking that \\nemployees stay home (with pay) if they feel \\nill or show symptoms are all critical steps to \\nmaintaining a healthy work environment, our \\nprogram of regular testing gave our employees \\nadditional peace of mind as they returned to \\nthe office. Measures have been introduced on a \\nsite-by-site basis, timed to align with country-\\nspecific regulatory developments. \\n\\nOHS Performance\\nAbbott senior leadership regularly reviews \\nOHS data to help ensure continuous \\nimprovement in this area.\\n\\n \\n\\nLost-Time Case Rate9  \\nEmployee and Contractor\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nVehicle Accidents per Million Miles  \\nEmployees\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nRecordable Case Rate10  \\nEmployees\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n0.12\\n0.13\\n0.30\\n0.24\\n\\n2.61\\n2.7\\n3.9\\n4.1\\n\\n0.29\\n0.28\\n0.46\\n0.41\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nPROTECT A  \\nHEALTHY  \\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nWe are champions for health.

A clearly defined, robust \\ngovernance structure ensures the \\nenvironmental impact of these facilities  \\nis as positive as possible. \\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nEnvironmental governance and management \\nfall under our Environment, Health and \\nSafety (EHS) approach, led by our Board \\nof Directors and senior management. Our \\nEHS organization reports to the Senior Vice \\nPresident, Quality Assurance, Regulatory and \\nEngineering Services who, in turn, reports to \\nour Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Senior \\nVice President is also the executive sponsor \\nfor the development of our climate and \\nwater strategy. \\n\\nPolicies and Management Systems \\nOur policies and standards are updated regularly \\nto reflect best practices, regulatory trends and \\nrequirements. A comprehensive audit program \\nmonitors compliance and identifies potential \\nrisks to our business and employees. \\n\\nWe evaluate EHS risk factors for each site \\nannually, using insights to determine audit \\nfrequency. Following audits, corrective \\naction plans are developed, implemented and \\nmonitored where needed. \\n\\nEnvironmental and Ecosystem Protection\\nProtecting biodiversity and ecosystems is \\nkey to environmental management. Abbott \\nmaintains technical standards for preventing \\nunpermitted environmental releases that \\nfacilities must comply with alongside \\nrelevant external regulations. Many sites have \\nimplemented protective measures, including \\nprocesses to safeguard soil and groundwater, \\nprotect and restore wetlands and prairies, and \\nremove invasive species.\\n\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\nOur EHS policy requires that EHS liability and \\ncompliance evaluations are conducted prior \\nto all property and business acquisitions and \\ndivestitures. Compliance with our EHS policy \\nis also incorporated into all new acquisitions. \\nThe type of due diligence we undertake \\ndepends on the nature of the transaction:\\n\\n• •  Real property transactions: \\n\\nEnvironmental due diligence is conducted \\nto evaluate potential environmental risks \\nand liabilities associated with real property \\nacquisitions and divestitures. \\n\\n• •  Business acquisitions: In conjunction \\n\\nwith environmental due diligence, a \\ncompany’s EHS resources and programs \\nare assessed, gaps identified and resources \\nestimated to align with regulatory \\nrequirements and Abbott standards.\\n\\nAbbott develops multi-year integration plans \\nto ensure acquisitions align with our EHS \\nmanagement practices and standards. This \\nincludes providing training and resources to \\nenable implementation of our EHS policy. \\nProgress against integration plans is monitored \\nto help ensure their ongoing efficacy. The final \\nstep in integration plans is often an internal \\nEHS compliance audit to ensure acquired \\nbusinesses are fully aligned. \\n\\nEngaging Employees in Our Efforts \\nAll EHS employees receive training on \\nour standards and changing regulatory \\nrequirements. We maintain several employee \\nengagement initiatives, including: \\n\\n• •  Evaluating EHS leaders against \\n\\nperformance goals in annual reviews\\n\\n• •  Raising awareness of priority EHS issues \\n\\nthrough dedicated discussion forums\\n\\n• •  Recognizing exceptional performance \\n\\nthrough our annual EHS Awards Program \\n\\nAll EHS policies and standards are available \\nonline.

One way \\nwe do this is by reducing our emissions, \\nfinding more efficient ways to use energy \\nand limiting reliance on fossil fuels. \\n\\nOUR IMPACT\\nWe realize our emissions contribute to global \\nclimate change. Our operational activities \\nproduce Scope 1 (direct) and 2 (indirect)11 \\nemissions. Emissions from activities like business \\ntravel, waste disposal, raw material sourcing and \\nprocessing, and product distribution, packaging \\nand disposal — collectively known as Scope 3 \\nemissions — also contribute to our footprint. \\n\\nWe’re working to reduce the negative impacts \\nof our emissions by investing in renewable \\nenergy, reducing fleet fuel consumption, \\nincreasing manufacturing efficiency and \\npartnering with suppliers. \\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nWe maintain a robust program for recording \\nand reducing energy and air emissions, \\noutlined in both our Climate Responsible \\nEnergy Policy and Internal Energy Guidelines. \\nAlong with these documents, our Global EHS \\nGovernance team provides guidance on:\\n\\n• •  Energy efficiency in  \\n\\nmanufacturing operations\\n\\n• •  Low-carbon energy investments \\n\\n• •  Transportation fleet efficiency\\n\\n• •  Supply chain carbon footprint \\n\\n• •  Public reporting of our performance \\n\\nWe align with international frameworks — \\nincluding CDP and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) \\nProtocol — to measure, track, reduce and  \\nreport emissions.\\n\\n11 Scope 1 emissions result from owned and controlled sources.

By \\n2030, we plan to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions \\nby 30%12 (vs. 2018). \\n\\nWe have established a comprehensive program \\nfor reducing these emissions, including measures \\nto advance: \\n\\n• •  Operational energy efficiency, driving \\n\\nreductions in energy demands\\n\\n• •  Purchase of renewable energy \\n\\n• •  Electrification of industrial processes, \\n\\nspaces and fleets\\n\\n• •  Conversion to cleaner fuel options\\n\\n• •  Integration of sustainable engineering \\ntechnologies and concepts into projects\\n\\nEach Abbott business sets individual annual \\nenergy efficiency targets. Manufacturing sites \\nthat produce over 25,000 metric tons of CO2e \\nannually are required to set additional carbon \\nreduction goals. \\n\\nOur Scope 3 emissions constitute around 93% \\nof total emissions. We calculate them annually \\nusing the GHG Protocol Corporate Value \\nChain (Scope 3) Standard, referring to the 10 \\nScope 3 categories* that apply to Abbott (see \\nOur Carbon Footprint infographic). \\n\\nWe’re currently developing a quantitative \\ntarget for Scope 3 emissions. This will include \\nworking with key carbon-intensive suppliers \\non emission reduction solutions. Read more \\nabout supply chain efforts on page 62. \\n\\nWe have our data assured every year. All \\nScope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as Scope \\n3 emissions related to business travel and \\noperational waste production, are verified \\nthrough a third-party assurance process. Our \\nlatest assurance statement is available on our \\nEnvironmental Policy page. \\n\\nRegulated Air Emissions \\nThe production of some Abbott products \\ninvolves substances that are ozone-depleting \\nor classified as hazardous or toxic air \\npollutants (HAPs) by local environmental \\nprotection agencies. We require all Abbott \\nfacilities using these substances to take all \\nnecessary steps to ensure the protection of \\nhuman health and the environment. This \\nincludes adhering to all applicable regulations, \\nas well as to Abbott technical standards.\\n\\nOur Supplier Guidelines establish that  \\nthe same standards are expected of all  \\nAbbott suppliers. \\n\\n12 Target expected to be validated by SBTi in 2022. 2030 targets will be measured in terms of CO2e emissions.

When adjusted for sales, \\nScope 1 and 2 emissions decreased 17% \\nover this same time period. In 2021, as our \\nproducts  — including COVID-19 testing and \\ndiagnostics — became increasingly important \\nfor patients and healthcare workers globally, \\nwe expanded production, which has come \\nwith a rise in emissions. As we move forward, \\nwe continue to identify ways to reduce our \\ncarbon footprint year-on-year to achieve our \\n2030 goal. \\n\\nA More Energy-Efficient Global Operation\\nTo reduce energy demand, we have made \\nseveral operational energy-efficient \\nimprovements as retrofits to existing \\nequipment or through active and efficient \\nin-house energy management. Several sites \\nuse energy data and innovative methods to \\nidentify and quantify energy inefficiencies in \\nmanufacturing processes, often employing \\nexternal experts. These insights then inform \\na list of priority energy demand reduction \\nprojects across the global business. \\n\\nFor example, in Indonesia, many of our motors \\nhave been upgraded with variable speed \\ndrives, reducing energy requirements while \\nretaining performance. \\n\\nOur manufacturing site in Singapore achieved \\nan 8% CO2 emissions intensity reduction in \\n2021 even with an 11% increase in volume, \\nthrough initiatives pioneered by our Utilities \\nExcellence team. More than 200 metric tons \\nCO2e annual reduction were realized by \\ninstalling a boiler oxygen management system \\nin our three steam boilers. This increased \\nboiler efficiency by 3%, by controlling excess \\noxygen and fuel ratio to increase percentage \\nof complete combustion. Another project to \\nupgrade cooling-tower fins, louvres and  \\nin-fills resulted in an annual reduction of about \\n250 metric tons CO2e.\\n\\nTo reduce safety and supply chain risk, one \\nof our facilities in Peru switched from using \\nliquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to feed the \\nboilers, kitchen and laboratory workstations \\nto instead supply with natural gas. This switch \\nalso resulted in a financial saving, plus an \\nenvironmental benefit of an annual GHG \\nemission reduction of about 20 metric tons. \\n\\nPowering Our Facilities Renewably \\nWe are committed to purchasing a greater \\nproportion of electricity from renewable \\nsources and are developing a Renewable \\nEnergy Procurement initiative to drive \\ncontinuous improvement in this area. In 2021, \\nwe purchased 190 million kWh of low-carbon \\nand renewable energy, resulting in savings of \\n80,000 metric tons of CO2e. In addition, we \\nalso generated 1.8 million kWh from solar \\ninstallations at eight of our sites. \\n\\nIncreasingly Green Transport \\nWe have established a range of initiatives to \\nmanage fuel consumption in our commercial \\nfleet as well as the fuel consumption during \\nemployee commuting. These include \\nestablishing increasingly robust requirements \\nfor vehicle fuel efficiency, providing on-site \\nelectric vehicle charging stations, promoting \\ncar-sharing and, where possible, public \\ntransportation use.\\n\\nBringing Greater Clarity to \\nScope\\xa03\\xa0Emissions \\nTo expand understanding of Scope 3 emissions, \\nwe partnered with an external consultant to \\nupdate our calculation methodology. This \\nincluded assessing our supplier-affiliated Scope 3 \\ncategories to identify priority sourcing categories \\nfor transitioning to an average-data calculation \\n\\nmethod.13 Through the exercise, we have \\nupdated the emission calculation methodology \\nfor 47% of our carbon-intensive categories, \\nresulting in a more accurate, representative 2020 \\nScope 3 baseline recalculation.\\n\\nSee page 93 for a detailed breakdown of our \\nemissions and energy metrics. \\n\\nLighting Our Facilities Sustainably \\nUpgrading sites to LED lighting is one of the \\nways we are mitigating CO2e emissions. In \\n2021, several facilities made the switch to \\nLEDs throughout the year, most notably our \\nsite in South Carolina, where approximately \\n240 light fixtures were upgraded across the \\nvarious production areas. Taken together, this \\nswitch will result in annual financial savings \\nof over $16,500 and energy savings of over \\n187,100 kWh. \\n\\n5% \\n\\nABSOLUTE REDUCTION \\nin Scope 1 and 2 emissions (vs. 2018)\\n\\n17%\\n\\nREDUCTION \\nin Scope 1 and 2 emissions  \\n(vs. 2020, normalized to sales)\\n\\n13 A method that estimates emissions for goods and services based \\non the mass or other relevant units of goods and services purchased \\nmultiplied by relevant secondary emission factors.\\n\\nDisclosing Climate-Related Risks \\nand Strategies \\nThe Task Force on Climate-related \\nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) outlines \\nhow companies should report on \\nclimate-related risks and mitigation \\nstrategies and covers four core elements: \\n• •  Governance\\n• •  Strategy\\n• •  Risk management\\n• •  Metrics and targets\\nIt includes recommended disclosures \\nthat companies should make for each \\narea.

In response, work is now \\nunderway to replace the probes with alternatives \\nthat can withstand higher temperatures of \\nsteam condensate, eliminating the need for \\ncooling water. \\nThe first phase of the project will save the site \\napproximately 3.2 million gallons of soft water \\nand 106,000 gallons of make-up water. We \\nreceived capital project funds to complete \\na second phase, adding six additional high-\\ntemperature probes to our system. These new \\nprobes will allow continuous monitoring of our \\nsix largest condensate return legs, saving an \\nestimated additional 200,000 gallons of  \\nmake-up water per year with annual savings  \\nof $2,800.\\nOverall, the improvements will save the site \\napproximately 3.5 million gallons of water per \\nyear, a 2% reduction in water intake. The overall \\neconomic impact of both phases of the project \\ntotals $27,000 in annual savings.\\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nFoundational elements have been set to \\nsupport future water stewardship certification \\nand management practices. \\n\\nWater Stewardship Certification \\nWe aim to achieve water stewardship \\ncertification at all high water impact \\nmanufacturing sites in water-stressed regions. \\nIn 2021, 25 of our manufacturing sites were \\nidentified as operating in areas of water stress. \\nOf those, 48% used less than 15 million gallons \\nof water while nine sites were deemed high \\nimpact considering basin water stress, basin \\nwater depletion level and water usage. Aligned \\nwith our context-based approach and based \\non the potential for these sites to significantly \\nimpact local communities, we have targeted \\nthem for AWS water stewardship certification. \\nAlignment with the standard is intended to \\nachieve five main outcomes: \\n\\n• •  Good water governance\\n\\n• •  Sustainable water balance\\n\\n• •  Good water quality status \\n\\n• •  Important water-related areas \\n\\n• •  Safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)\\n\\nWe have established a Community of \\nPractice for our nine High Water Impact \\nSites to support progress toward AWS water \\nstewardship certification. Strategic roadmaps \\nhighlight key steps for achieving certification.\\n\\nWater Stewardship Management Practices \\nWe will implement accredited water \\nstewardship management practices in more \\nthan 75% of all manufacturing sites operating in \\nwater-stressed regions by 2030. In 2021, we set \\nthis in motion for 16 sites identified as being in \\nwater-stressed areas not classified as being high \\nwater impact. While these sites have less impact \\nthan our high water impact facilities, it is also \\nimportant for them to adopt water stewardship \\npractices that support achievement of the \\noutcomes described above. \\n\\nDraft accredited water stewardship practices \\nare currently under expert review. They will \\nbe finalized in 2022 alongside a supporting \\nguidance document. The new Community of \\nPractice will help sites stay on track through \\nquarterly reporting and act as a resource for \\nshared learning between facilities.\\n\\nWater-Saving Solutions\\nTotal water intake in 2021 rose by \\napproximately 4% versus the previous year — \\na result of increased production in 2021. When \\nadjusted for sales, water intake decreased 16% \\ncompared to 2020. Nonetheless, we continually \\nlook for ways to reduce absolute withdrawals — \\nwith a particular focus on those facilities in \\nwater-stressed areas. In Minnesota, low-flow \\nfaucets and fixtures have been installed, saving \\nthe site 73,000 gallons in a single year. In Costa \\nRica, we are reducing reliance on groundwater \\nby harvesting rainwater and reusing water \\n\\nfrom our cooling towers in the site toilets and \\nirrigation system.\\n\\nOur efforts in Spain — where we operate \\nin a water-stressed area — are even more \\nsubstantial. We have achieved significant \\nreductions in both water use and wastewater \\nproduction by installing a second RO water \\npurification system. By increasing capacity to \\nrecover and treat 70% of water rejected by the \\nfirst RO system, across 2020 and 2021 we saved \\nover 8 million gallons of water. Additionally, by \\nreducing well water consumption by 11%, the \\nsite has also achieved notable energy savings \\nof 12,800 kWh every year — and avoided \\napproximately 3.7 metric tons of CO2e.\\n\\nRead more about our emission reductions on \\npage 43. \\n\\nIdentifying Supply Chain Focus Points \\nIn addition to addressing direct water impacts, \\nby 2030 we aim to work with 50 key suppliers \\nin high water-stressed areas to reduce quality \\nand quantity risks in our supply chain. In 2021, \\nwe performed an assessment to identify key \\nsuppliers to further engage on efforts.

We are committed to \\n\\nfinding responsible and economical ways to \\nreduce the volume of waste we produce and \\nensure effective disposal practices. At the \\nsame time, we are innovating our processes to \\nmaximize resource recovery. \\n\\nThe standard governing of our practices \\napplies to both hazardous and nonhazardous \\nwaste, as well as our beneficial-use activities. \\nIt specifies a range of waste management \\nstrategies, including: \\n\\n•  Process waste reduction through \\n\\ndiagnosing and fixing problems that would \\notherwise result in waste generation \\n\\n•  Reducing waste through product design, \\nmaterial input and purchasing decisions \\n\\n•  Partnering across other value chains to \\n\\npromote beneficial use \\n\\n•  Ensuring proper waste material segregation \\n\\n•  Recycling and incinerating with   \\n\\n•  Preventive maintenance and process design \\n\\nenergy recovery \\n\\nto eliminate waste generation \\n\\nWorking to Close the Loop on Waste\\n\\nRefurbish and remanufacture\\n\\nRecycle\\n\\nReuse and redistribute\\n\\nMaintenance\\n\\nNATURAL  \\nRESOURCES\\n\\nMANUFACTURE\\n\\n88.5%\\n\\nTRASH\\n\\n11.5%\\n\\nManaging Hazardous and  \\nChemical Waste\\nWe are prioritizing reducing the proportion \\nof waste classified as hazardous (around \\n11.2% of our 2021 waste footprint).

In addition, now that fiber \\ndrums are back to being sent to an external \\npartner for beneficial use, we are still using the \\ndechimer to break down lower-quality drums \\nthat the vendor cannot take, which will result \\nin an estimated 4.8 U.S. tons per year increase \\nin recycling, and corresponding decrease in \\nincineration, of fiber drums. \\n\\nSee page 107 for a detailed breakdown of our \\nwaste metrics. \\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE \\nWaste production did increase in 2021 due \\nto increased production, as well as a rise in \\nconstruction waste from expansion projects to \\nallow for production growth. When adjusted for \\nsales, waste production decreased 8.6% versus \\n2020. We continue to identify opportunities to \\ndivert materials from landfill, and advance the \\nZero Waste-to-Landfill initiative we launched \\nin 2012. In 2021, seven manufacturing facilities \\nand one non-manufacturing facility received \\nZero Waste-to-Landfill certification, bringing \\nour total number of facilities certified through \\nthis program to 38 manufacturing and eight \\nnon-manufacturing facilities. \\n\\nOne of our facilities in Norway developed a \\ngreat cross-functional Waste Management team \\nthat is very active. The site demonstrated the \\nfollowing key elements of a successful waste \\nmanagement program:\\n\\n• •  Senior Leadership buy-in and site-level \\n\\nsupport of the program\\n\\n• •  Clear lines of responsibility for \\nwaste management, including \\nongoing communications on waste \\nmanagement performance\\n\\n• •  Initial and ongoing training and supporting \\n\\nStandard Operating Procedure for \\nwaste management\\n\\n• •  Excellent recordkeeping and interaction \\nwith current vendor to allow for higher \\nlevels of waste management\\n\\n• •  Ongoing site-wide communications on \\n\\nwaste management performance\\n\\n• •  Proactive program that continues to focus \\n\\non capturing more value from waste\\n\\n• •  At the time of audit, the site was maintaining \\n\\na diversion rate of 100% (no waste sent to \\nlandfill or incineration without energy) thus \\neffectively capturing value from waste\\n\\nEach facility tailors waste management initiatives \\nto address its most pressing issues, following the \\nprinciples of reduce, reuse and recycle. \\n\\nReduce \\nAt both the Abbott Park corporate \\nheadquarters and Core Diagnostics operations \\nin Illinois, we started an initiative in March \\n2021 to reduce waste generation from these \\nsites by sending baled corrugated cardboard to \\na third party for beneficial use. The cardboard \\nis used as cellulose insulation for homes and \\ncommercial buildings. While pushing the \\nmanagement of this material further up the \\nwaste hierarchy increased our overall costs \\nrather than providing cost savings, it resulted \\nin a waste reduction of nearly 200 U.S. tons \\n(193.5 U.S. tons) for these locations in 2021. We \\n\\nare continuing this initiative after 2021 and \\nproject over 200 U.S. tons of baled corrugated \\ncardboard will be sent to the third party for \\nbeneficial use every year going forward. \\n\\nReuse \\nIn Costa Rica, our team is finding ways to reuse \\nGaylord shipping containers, cutting both waste \\nproduction and costs associated with product \\ndistribution. For health and safety purposes, \\ncontainers have historically been used once. \\nHowever, our studies found that, with proper \\nsterilization methods, each container could \\nbe used twice before being disposed of. The \\nteam is now in the process of transitioning to \\nmulti-use, updating procedures for handling \\nthe shipping containers and assessing their \\ncondition prior to reuse. \\n\\nRecycle \\nIn one of our U.S. nutrition plants, prior to \\nCOVID-19, fiber drums were sent to an external \\npartner for beneficial reuse (resale). During \\nthe pandemic, these vendor activities slowed, \\nresulting in the accumulation of fiber drums \\nat our on-site Recycle Center. In response, \\nwe invested in a dechimer machine to break \\ndrums down into their cardboard and metal \\ncomponents so each can be recycled.

To reduce \\nour raw material burden, we are optimizing \\nefficiency by minimizing the volume and \\nweight of our packaging. We are also \\nemploying circularity principles to incorporate \\nincreased quantities of recycled content and \\ndesigning for recyclability, reusability and \\nincreasingly positive impact. \\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nWe want to design our packaging with \\nsustainability in mind. Many Abbott functions \\ncollaborate to help ensure sustainability \\nconsiderations are prioritized during product \\nand packaging design and manufacture.\\n\\nEach division has provided projections for \\nthe next decade of packaging projects.

Our \\nSustainable Packaging Guiding Principles — \\nrecently created by the Sustainable Packaging \\nCouncil — inform changes to existing \\npackaging and target new designs that integrate \\nsustainability from the very beginning. \\n\\n• •  Utilize renewable materials  \\n\\n• •  Integrate recycled content\\n\\nBalance All Aspects of Packaging  \\nSystems Holistically\\n\\n• •  Optimize cube efficiency \\n\\n• •  Provide consumer direction \\n\\n• •  Improve carbon footprint\\n\\nWorking With Suppliers\\nWe’re working with suppliers to create lower \\nimpact packaging that supports our circular \\neconomy approach. Together, we identify \\nsolutions that either eliminate packaging \\nmaterials supplied to us or ensure those we \\ndo receive can be reused in manufacturing \\nprocesses. This includes optimizing design \\nto reduce material use — particularly \\nplastics — improving shipping efficiencies, \\nincreasing fiber-based packaging sustainability \\nand introducing reusable options.

We continuously monitor these \\nmaterials in our supply chain and operations \\nto ensure we are complying with relevant \\nregulations and minimizing negative outcomes. \\nOther supply chain activities — including how \\nraw materials are produced and transported — \\ncontribute to global emissions, waste \\nproduction and animal welfare issues. We \\npartner closely with key suppliers to identify \\nalternative, more responsible approaches. \\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nTo identify and mitigate the environmental \\nimpacts of our packaging and products \\nthroughout their life cycles — and at every \\nstage of the value chain — relevant teams must \\nwork together. Our Product Stewardship, \\nSupply Chain, R&D, Engineering and EHS \\ngroups partner closely to analyze how and \\nwhat we source. \\n\\nStrategic sourcing initiatives are described in \\nthe Supply Chain section of this report on  \\npage 70. \\n\\nProduct Stewardship \\nProduct stewardship focuses on minimizing \\nuse of hazardous chemicals and substances \\nof concern, and carefully managing critical \\nmaterials in products, packaging and \\nmanufacturing processes to ensure compliance \\nwith applicable regulations. It stretches \\nfrom design through end of life, promoting a \\ncircular economy approach to our products. \\n\\nEach business conducts assessments of new \\nand changed products for substances of \\nconcern, or restricted and critical materials. \\nRisk assessments are prepared whenever these \\nsubstances are identified. We then evaluate: \\n\\n• •  Whether continued use can be justified \\n\\n• •  The value of use versus reformulation \\n\\n• •  Any potential compliance issues \\n\\nThe evaluation also serves as an opportunity \\nto research suitable alternatives and how \\nthey could impact product performance and \\ncost. Recommendations for next steps contain \\njustification for substance use, product  \\nsupport strategies and a business risk \\nmonitoring plan. These are all reviewed by \\nbusiness management. \\n\\nWe continuously monitor the regulatory \\nlandscape and any change to hazardous \\nchemical requirements. Our Corporate \\nProduct Stewardship organization holds \\nregular forums for informing all areas of our \\ncompany about the potential business impacts \\nthese changes could have. Our enhanced \\nregulatory intelligence process helps ensure \\npotential impacts are identified in a timely \\nmanner. It also follows actions taken at the \\nbusiness level to confirm we remain compliant. \\n\\nOur product stewardship program tracks and \\naddresses hazardous chemical legislation \\nand supports the implementation of due \\ndiligence on conflict minerals. We offer \\nproduct stewardship training on hazardous \\nchemical legislation and conflict minerals to all \\nrelevant teams, including R&D, Supply Chain, \\nProcurement and EHS.\\n\\n18 A Form SD is an Exchange Act Form used to satisfy special \\ndisclosure requirements implemented under the Dodd-Frank Wall \\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\\n\\nHazardous Chemicals and \\nConflict Minerals \\nHazardous chemicals are those that \\npose a risk to human health and \\nthe environment. Responding to \\nregulations on them is key to our \\nproduct stewardship program and \\nimpacts how our products can be \\nused, recycled and disposed of. We \\nensure the marketing and sale of \\nour products comply with current \\nregulations, not just those in place at \\nthe time of product\\xa0development.\\nConflict minerals include tantalum, \\ntin, tungsten and gold\\xa0— also known as \\n3TG minerals. We have a robust due \\ndiligence process for understanding \\nsourcing and use of them in our \\nproducts and supply chain. We file \\nan annual Form SD18 and Conflict \\nMinerals report each year with \\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange \\nCommission (available on our website). \\nWe are a member of the Responsible \\nMinerals Initiative and use its \\nReporting Template to survey suppliers \\non conflict materials.

It sets a global \\nstandard while supporting product-by-product monitoring. While we already \\nmaintain best-in-class, on-time medical device reporting (MDR), in 2021, \\nour Quality and Regulatory team established a Human Error and Reliability \\nOptimization project to target continual progress. The project introduces measures \\nto address behaviors that can contribute to human error, including:\\n• •  Examining current factors to assure on-time reporting\\n• • \\n• •  Developing in-depth investigation tools based on these categories\\n• •  Establishing a solution matrix to proactively address issues\\n• • \\n\\nImplementing a Case Reference Catalog to record learnings and support \\ndevelopment of corrective and preventative actions \\n\\n Categorizing these identified factors\\n\\nThrough this process, we will strive to achieve 100% on-time MDR across Abbott, \\nensuring regulatory compliance.\\nAdditionally, our Pharmaceuticals business uses a single pharmacovigilance (PV) \\nsystem for marketed products to monitor worldwide safety reports and ensure \\ndisclosures to relevant authorities. Information is collected on suspected adverse \\nreactions through a global database, with each case investigated and communicated \\nto relevant health authorities. This system is regularly reviewed by senior \\nmanagement while training is provided to support understanding among branded \\ngeneric medicine division employees.\\nQuality management decisions are made following product-specific safety \\nsurveillance based on predefined, risk-based criteria and applicable local legislation. \\n\\nQuality Management System \\nAbbott has implemented a Quality System \\nManual, based on established regulations and \\nindustry standards, which governs the specific \\nquality framework for each Abbott business \\nand division. The system is implemented \\nat a global level and incorporated into each \\ndivision and site. The Quality System elements \\nencompass the entire product life cycle — \\nfrom research and development, clinical \\nstudies and product design through risk \\nmanagement, material, production and process \\ncontrols and right up to distribution and post-\\nmarket surveillance. \\n\\nThe Quality Management System model and \\nmetrics are continuously reviewed to track \\nperformance at site, business and company \\nlevels. Key learnings and best practices, \\nincluding those from external intelligence, \\nare captured and applied elsewhere in our \\norganization. Where performance changes \\nare identified, we analyze root causes and take \\nnecessary corrective action. In targeted use \\ncases, we apply machine learning to enhance \\npredictions of potential risks. \\n\\nEach operating business maintains Quality \\nManagement Systems and performs audits in \\nline with governing regulations. Audits from \\nthe corporate level are also conducted. The \\nresults of all quality surveillance activities, \\nwhich are well documented, feed into \\ncontinuous improvement initiatives.\\n\\nEngaging Suppliers on Quality\\nOur suppliers play a key role in our product \\nquality and safety. A comprehensive, risk-\\nbased program ensures those that impact \\nour regulated products and/or Quality \\nManagement System conform to predefined \\nquality requirements. \\n\\nWe require suppliers to have a documented \\nQuality Management System that is \\ncommensurate with the products and services \\nthat they provide to Abbott. Continuous \\nmonitoring measures suppliers against \\nminimum performance criteria. Suppliers are \\nclassified according to risk level of potential \\nimpacts; evaluation frequency is determined \\nbased on this, ranging between every two \\n(high-risk) and four (low-risk) years. Read \\nabout how we categorize suppliers for \\nsustainability risks on page 67. \\n\\nEvaluations provide evidence that suppliers can \\ndeliver to our requirements, maintain adequate \\nQuality Management System elements and \\nconform business and process capabilities to \\nrelevant regulations and Abbott standards. On-\\nsite audits and additional agreements for high-\\nrisk partners confirm operational capabilities \\nand Quality Management System requirements. \\n\\nWe collaborate and partner with key  \\nsuppliers to continuously improve product \\nquality and safety.\\n\\nAssuring Commercial Quality \\nCommercial quality assurance (QA) ensures \\nsupply chain processes maintain product \\nquality and compliance.

Our efforts have included \\nincreasing our finished product testing; \\nconfirming process consistency; enhancing  \\nour environmental monitoring program; \\ninstalling non-porous, easily cleanable \\nsanitary floors; and implementing revised \\ntraffic control patterns to further protect the \\nmanufacturing environment.\\n\\nWe know that our decision to recall product \\nworsened the industry-wide formula shortage \\nin the U.S., and prior to restarting production \\nwe worked to get as much product as we \\ncould into the hands of parents by increasing \\nsupply at our other FDA registered facilities, \\nincluding bringing in Similac from our site \\nin Cootehill, Ireland, by air and producing \\nmore liquid Similac and Alimentum. We also \\nbegan releasing metabolic formulas that were \\npreviously on hold, to those who need these \\nunique formulas. \\n\\nThrough support from Abbott, Patient \\nAdvocate Foundation established a $5 million \\nPediatric Amino Acid Formula Emergency \\nAssistance Fund to help families of patients \\non amino acid-based formulas who’ve been \\n\\nhospitalized or encountered emergency room \\nvisits as a result of the formula shortage. The \\nfund will provide grants to help these families \\nwith medical and related living expenses.\\n\\nIn addition, we’ve offered an increased number \\nand value of coupons available for all our infant \\nformula products, including Similac ready-to-\\nfeed, to enable customers to purchase formula, \\neither free or deeply discounted. And we are \\nworking with the USDA and state Special \\nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, \\nInfants and Children (WIC) agencies and \\npaying rebates on competitive products in states \\nwhere Abbott holds the WIC contract, when \\nSimilac is not available. Abbott will continue to \\npay rebates for competitive products through \\nAugust 31. This means program participants \\nwill continue to be able to obtain formula, free \\nof charge whether it is Similac or formula from \\nanother manufacturer.\\n\\nFinally, we are making significant investments \\nto help ensure this never happens again.

It enables \\nassessment of this compliance and requires our \\nvendors to remediate any issues identified. \\n\\nAbbott’s Procurement professionals are \\nrequired to complete training on the \\nGuidelines and contract language to ensure \\nthese expectations are understood internally \\nand cascaded to our suppliers. Likewise, our \\nsuppliers are responsible for training their \\nemployees to meet the expectations detailed  \\nin the Guidelines. \\n\\nIn combination with our Supplier  \\nGuidelines, several additional policies \\nand guidelines further our supply chain \\nsustainability strategies: \\n\\n• •  Green Procurement Guidelines: \\n\\nsupport our Sourcing team to identify \\nenvironmentally preferable goods and \\nservices and request them from suppliers \\n\\n• •  Global Environmental, Health and \\n\\nSafety Policy: guides engagement with \\nstrategic stakeholders, suppliers and \\ncontractors to help ensure compliance \\nwith regulations and applicable Abbott \\nstandards to reduce EHS impacts\\n\\n• •  Supplier Diversity Guidelines: commit \\n\\nAbbott to equal opportunities for small \\nbusinesses and those owned or operated  \\nby members of underrepresented groups \\n\\n• •  Water Policy: sets supplier \\n\\nrequirements for transparency on water \\nmanagement practices \\n\\n• •  Climate Responsible Energy Guidelines: \\n\\nencourage suppliers to reduce emissions \\nand improve energy efficiency\\n\\n• •  Animal Welfare Policy: guides our work \\n\\nwith animal-related suppliers and contract \\nlaboratories, including expectations that \\nanimal use in any testing or process should \\noccur only after alternatives have been fully \\nexplored and rejected\\n\\n• •  Position Statement on Conflict Minerals: \\ndetails a process for understanding conflict \\nmineral sourcing and use, including \\nidentification of in-scope products and \\nsuppliers, supplier engagement and \\nrequirements to disclose the presence  \\nand source of conflict minerals in their \\nsupply chains\\n\\nRead more about how we ensure Abbott’s \\nstandards are upheld throughout the supply \\nchain on page 82.. \\n\\n65\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nEvolving Social Responsibility Language \\nIn 2021, we updated the language in our social \\nresponsibility clause that will be included in \\ndirect material contracts.

Our \\nsupplier assessment programs take a risk-\\nbased approach to determine assessment, \\nmonitoring and audit requirements. They \\nconsider supplier size, maturity, industry, \\nsourcing regions, ESG performance and \\nAbbott spend. This is particularly relevant \\nto our critical suppliers, but we also assess \\nnon-critical suppliers that operate in high \\nsustainability risk industries or regions with \\npotential risk exposure.\\n\\nAbbott utilizes a third-party risk monitoring \\ntool to perform real-time analysis of critical \\nsupplier sourcing locations, tracking \\npotential geopolitical, security, sustainability, \\nenvironmental and infrastructure risks. \\nSustainability risk scores consider \\nperformance in employee autonomy, workers’ \\nrights, child labor and environmental factors. \\nWe also use the tool to monitor supply \\nchain disruptions and to identify suppliers \\nand locations that pose potential business \\ncontinuity risk. These insights then inform our \\nsourcing strategy and contingency plans.\\n\\nAdditional risk-specific analyses are performed \\nfor strategic sourcing categories and regions \\nwhen potential risks are identified. \\n\\nSupplier Survey and Audit Program \\nAbbott’s Supplier Sustainability Survey and \\nAudit Program is an ongoing effort that \\nenables global supply chain assessment and \\nengagement on a broad range of sustainability \\ntopics. Through a two-year cycle, we identify \\nand engage potential high sustainability risk \\nsuppliers, as well as those with the greatest \\nopportunities to address shared sustainability \\nimpacts, to evaluate their sustainability risks \\nand ensure business continuity. \\n\\nFirst, our global supply base is assessed, \\nconsidering overall sustainability impacts, as \\nwell as topic-specific impacts such as human \\nrights and labor, EHS risk, waste diversion \\nopportunities, climate impacts and carbon \\nmanagement. Then 150–300 potentially high \\nsustainability risk suppliers are identified \\nby our Procurement and Business teams for \\nparticipation in Abbott’s annual Supplier \\nSustainability Survey. The survey helps us \\nunderstand supplier sustainability maturity \\nand opportunities to improve supply chain \\nsustainability and resilience, covering:\\n\\n• •  Management systems\\n\\n• •  Compliance and reporting\\n\\n• •  Ethics\\n\\n• •  Human rights and labor practices\\n\\n• •  Health and safety\\n\\n• •  Environmental performance\\n\\n• •  Supply chain management\\n\\nSuppliers are determined to be “high \\nsustainability risk” when responses are not \\naligned with the expectations outlined in our \\nSupplier Guidelines. \\n\\nAfter reviewing the survey results, suppliers \\nselected for audit are notified and audited \\nby an external third-party auditor using \\nWorkplace Conditions Assessment (WCA) — \\nor other globally recognized — standards. \\nThese standards assess a supplier’s social \\nand labor conditions, health and safety, \\nenvironment and business practices at the \\nfacility level.

These programs \\nare detailed on pages 70–73. \\n\\nInsights collected through these supplier \\nassessment and engagement programs support \\nbetter supplier engagement and inform \\ndevelopment of sustainability initiatives for \\nimplementation at the supplier, sourcing and/\\nor business level. \\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE \\nEngaging the Right Global Suppliers \\nIn 2021, 210 suppliers covering 25% of spend \\nwere engaged through Abbott’s Supplier \\nSustainability Survey. We also updated \\nthe survey to better understand risks and \\nopportunities in line with current and \\nemerging sustainability-related issues and our \\n2030 goals. \\n\\nIn addition to survey respondents, 51 high \\nsustainability risk suppliers were audited with \\noverall findings indicating Abbott is limited \\nto minimal sustainability risk based on the \\nsuppliers assessed.22 \\n\\nSafeguarding Business Continuity and \\nSupply Chain Risk Mitigation \\nRisk profiling, global event monitoring and an \\nalert system support identification of potential \\nsupply disruptions and inform proactive \\nresponses. In 2021, our risk profiling exercise \\nmore than doubled the number of supply chain \\nareas monitored. \\n\\nTo further safeguard our business and supply \\nchain against unforeseen events, we created a \\nSupply Chain Resilience program to develop \\npeople, processes and tools to evaluate and \\nengage with suppliers on identified topics. \\n2021 actions included an end-to-end risk \\nassessment for products identified as critical \\nor constituting the top 80% of revenue for \\neach business, and establishment of standard \\nmetrics for measuring internal and external \\nrisks. In total, over 50 products were profiled; \\nthis included more than 2,500 unique supply \\nchain points, such as suppliers, plants and \\ndistribution centers.\\n\\nThroughout 2021, COVID-19 remained a \\nchallenge to supply chain resilience. In \\nresponse, we maintained precautions put in \\nplace the previous year, including building an \\ninventory of raw materials and finished goods \\nto help ensure supply continuity. We continued \\nto monitor performance at manufacturing \\nsites in known COVID-19 hotspots to inform \\ncontingency plans.

Suppliers are evaluated \\nvia a questionnaire depending on the level of \\nrisk assigned. \\n\\nAn on-site visit24 may be triggered if a supplier \\nis determined high-risk from questionnaire \\nreview, if it’s had a significant incident, \\nreceived notice of violation or negative media \\nreporting, or is identified by one of our internal \\nstakeholders. Upon completion of the on-site \\nassessment, suppliers are assigned a risk status \\nand follow-up actions are determined, including \\nCAPA execution by the supplier, continuation \\nof business activities, identification of back-up \\nsuppliers and/or implementation of an exit \\nstrategy. By assessing suppliers this way, we aim \\nto minimize environmental risks and ensure \\nbusiness continuity.\\n\\nIn 2021, 48 self-assessments were completed \\nby suppliers. On-site visits of 39 suppliers — \\n16 of which were desk-based as a result of \\nCOVID — were completed by Abbott or third-\\nparty subject matter experts. Of the on-site \\nassessments completed, six were shared with \\nindustry partners through the PSCI data-\\nsharing platform.\\n\\nAddressing Supply Chain Water Risks \\nBy 2030, we aim to work with 50 key suppliers \\nin high water-stressed areas to reduce risks \\nto water quality and quantity. In 2021, we \\nconducted a water risk assessment to identify \\nkey suppliers. Using the World Resources \\nInstitute (WRI) AqueductTM Global Water Tool, \\nthis assessment considered supplier industries, \\nsourcing locations and level of water stress. \\nOf those identified, 26 suppliers representing \\n4% of total 2021 spend were engaged through \\nour Supplier Sustainability Survey to better \\nunderstand existing water risk mitigation \\nefforts and opportunities.\\n\\nAgriculture and Addressing Deforestation \\nAbbott is a leader in sustainability, with an \\ninternal surveillance program that tests above \\nindustry requirements. Our Food and Safety \\nCouncil (including representatives from \\nSupply Chain, Regulatory, and Research and \\nDevelopment) meets on a quarterly basis to \\naddress concerns related to our agriculture \\nsupply chain, including sustainability \\nissues.

Abbott’s EHS, Procurement and Supply \\nChain teams are committed to developing \\nand tracking waste diversion initiatives in \\ncollaboration with our key suppliers.\\n\\nIn 2021, we established a process and criteria \\nfor identifying suppliers with the greatest \\npotential to influence the environmental \\nimpacts of Abbott’s inbound materials \\nthat become waste from our operations. \\nOur approach included engaging Abbott \\nmanufacturing sites with significant \\nwaste production to identify the suppliers \\ncontributing the greatest impacts to our \\n\\nwaste footprint. We also broadened our scope \\nto include our largest suppliers in strategic \\nsourcing categories. \\n\\nThrough this process, we identified over \\n60 suppliers with potential inbound waste \\npartnership opportunities; a representative \\nsample of almost 40 was engaged through \\nAbbott’s Supplier Sustainability Survey to \\nidentify future opportunities to collaborate. \\n\\nPartnering With Suppliers for Reuse and \\nResponsible Waste Management\\nWe partner with waste management suppliers \\nto ensure our waste is responsibly handled \\nand disposed of and, where feasible, divert it \\nfrom landfill and incineration without energy \\nrecovery. This includes seeking opportunities \\n\\nto reuse and recycle materials and targeting \\nbeneficial-use activities, where waste is sent \\nto off-site partners for use as a substitute to \\ncommercial products and commodities. \\n\\nOur technical standard for evaluating \\nand approving vendors mandates ethical, \\nresponsible approaches to waste management \\nand aims to minimize risks associated with \\nwhat we dispose of. For manufacturing sites \\nthat produce more than 1,200 kilograms of \\nhazardous waste annually, our Waste Vendor \\nAssessment program requires on-site audits \\nof waste management firms at least every five \\nyears. This program has assessed 717 waste \\nvendors within the last five years and 139 in \\n2021.

Our Anti-Corruption Compliance \\nEnhancement (ACE) program evaluates \\nspecific commercial practices to identify \\npotential compliance risks. Corruption risks \\nare also included in enterprise-wide risk \\nassessments conducted at least annually by our \\ncorporate audit group. \\n\\nEnterprise risk management (ERM) focuses on \\nrisks that have the potential to impact business \\nperformance. It continuously evaluates \\nlikelihood, impact and velocity to ensure our \\nmanagement team focuses efforts in the most \\nrelevant areas. Our ERM Network team — \\n14 functional experts led by Abbott’s Vice \\nPresident, Internal Audit — brings consistency \\nand structure to risk evaluation and integrates \\nERM throughout our business. The Vice \\nPresident, Internal Audit presents annual \\nupdates to the Audit Committee and completes \\ndetailed reviews of specific enterprise risks. The \\nBoard and its committees review enterprise risks \\nthroughout the year. \\n\\nEmerging Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nResponse\\n\\nDisruptive technologies\\n\\nTechnology is increasingly important in healthcare. As requirements for connected solutions grow, we \\nface increasing industry competition and from technology companies branching out into healthcare. The \\nimpact of the pandemic has accelerated the need for products that converge technology and healthcare \\nat an unprecedented speed. This presents a challenge where we face competitors not only in our own \\nindustry but technology players who are currently making strides into the healthcare sector. We view \\nthese challenges as an accelerator to our innovation and as an opportunity to develop products that can \\naddress health needs through meaningful innovation that is guided by patient needs. We see this as an \\nopportunity to advance Abbott solutions, partnering across industries on increasingly effective solutions. \\nThe changing landscape poses new opportunities at the intersection of healthcare and technology. The \\nconvergence of healthcare and technology has shifted the spectrum of care from hospitals and healthcare \\ninstitutions to digital solutions and remote therapy, from reacting to disease management to preventative \\ncare and wellness, and from general diagnosis to customization of care. To remain competitive, our \\ntechnologies must be science-driven, consumer-friendly, accessible, affordable and relevant. Abbott is \\ncreating solutions that enable self-diagnosis, offering devices and digital platforms that connect patients \\nand doctors and enable quicker, better-informed decisions. Our 2030 Sustainability Plan focuses on \\ndesigning access and affordability into our life-changing technologies and products. This plan requires us \\nto design our technologies and products for broader access and affordability at every step\\xa0— from every \\nphase of our R&D process, to the materials we use, to manufacturing, to the ways we reach the people \\nwho need them.\\n\\nFrom pandemic to endemic\\xa0— the new normal As COVID-19 continues to create significant impacts and uncertainties for the global economy, we have \\n\\nexecuted proactive and reactive risk mitigation strategies specifically focused on COVID-19 and novel \\nviruses to keep history from repeating itself. Increased likelihood of pandemics represents an opportunity \\nto advance research capabilities. Through the formation of the Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition\\xa0— \\nthe first of its kind\\xa0— we are able to detect threats sooner and respond quicker. In addition, we have \\ndeveloped a suite of COVID-19 testing platforms that supports multiple different diagnostic solutions for \\nthe different stages of infection and recovery. \\nWhile we continue to remain alert on the pandemic front, we must also have the foresight to prepare to \\nmove from pandemic to endemic. Our efforts in meeting the world’s COVID-19 testing demands have \\nnot detracted our investments and ability to deliver strong growths in our Medical Devices, Nutrition, \\nEstablished Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics businesses. As highlighted in our annual reports and press \\nreleases for the past two years, we have delivered a continued stream of new products and initiatives \\naround the world, signifying progress and balanced strength in all four business segments.\\n\\n77\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nEthics and Integrity \\n\\nActing ethically and with integrity is of \\nthe utmost importance to Abbott.

Each Abbott business \\nand function has OEC staff members who \\nsupport implementation of the ethics and \\ncompliance program. Outside the U.S., regional \\nOEC personnel oversee country-specific \\ncompliance requirements.\\n\\nA SHARED COMMITMENT  \\nTO INTEGRITY \\nWe want to build a culture of integrity and \\ncompliance, engaging every employee in \\nupholding ethical behaviors. Our global online \\nLegal and Ethical Resource Network (LERN) \\ntraining program is run in 91 countries and \\n32 languages. It informs employees of all \\naspects of our Code of Business Conduct, \\nwith practical guidance on recognizing and \\nresponding to legal and ethical issues. \\n\\nFull- and part-time employees are assigned \\nLERN courses based on their role and \\nresponsibilities. In 2021, over 104,000 \\nemployees completed lessons. The LERN \\ncurriculum also includes certifications on the \\ncode and conflicts of interest, with a key focus \\non interactions with healthcare professionals. \\nAll Abbott employees are expected to review \\nand sign these annually.\\n\\nIn 2021, we launched Ethics and Compliance \\nWeek to drive awareness and engage with \\nemployees on compliance-related topics \\nthrough global and region-specific initiatives. \\nEthics and Compliance Week kicked off \\nwith a company-wide email titled “Are You \\non the Right Path When it Comes to Ethics \\nand Compliance?” that was viewed by over \\n55,000 employees. This was followed by a \\nmessage from Abbott’s CECO and select \\nexecutive vice presidents on the importance \\nof integrity and upholding Abbott values, \\nwhich was available in 24 languages and \\nviewed by over 57,000 employees. Highlighting \\nEthics and Compliance Week activities in the \\nU.S., additional compliance messages were \\n\\nviewed by over 23,000 employees, inviting \\nthem to nominate Compliance Heroes who \\nlive our commitment to integrity every \\nday. The OEC received 420 nominations, \\nand ultimately recognized 27 employees as \\nCompliance Heroes. In Latin America, Ethics \\nand Compliance Week activities included an \\nOlympics of Ethics and Compliance challenge \\nthat attracted more than 4,000 participants. \\nOther regions engaged in similar activities, \\nranging from communications to interactive \\nsessions designed to reinforce compliance \\npolicies and programs. \\n\\nOn December 9, recognized as International \\nAnti-Corruption Day, Abbott’s CECO sent \\na company-wide email available in 25 \\nlanguages, raising awareness of corruption \\nand highlighting Abbott’s commitment to \\ncombat and prevent bribery and corruption. \\nThe communication included links to Abbott’s \\nAnti-Corruption Overview as well as other \\ntools such as LERN training modules, our \\nThird Party Compliance program and our \\nSpeak Up reporting tool. \\n\\nInteracting With Healthcare \\nProfessionals \\nCertain countries require additional \\ntransparency and restrict how \\nbusinesses can interact with \\nhealthcare professionals. We comply \\nfully, providing additional certification \\nand reporting payments and transfers \\nof value.

It outlines \\nour company values and the expectation for \\nour employees to live them every day. Every \\nemployee is required to read and certify \\nadherence to the code annually. \\n\\nOur code and other policies align with \\nguidelines issued by medical technology trade \\nassociations such as AdvaMed, APACMed, \\nMedTech Europe and Mecomed. Additionally, \\nour policies and procedures align with \\nregulatory licenses and approvals we obtain \\nto promote, sell and import medical devices, \\ndiagnostics, nutrition products and medicines. \\n\\nOur Nutrition business is committed to \\ndeveloping science-based products for all ages \\nand to marketing these products ethically and in \\ncompliance with all local laws and regulations. \\nWe maintain robust systems for ensuring \\nconduct at every business level aligns with our \\nGlobal Infant Formula Marketing Policy and \\nlaws in the countries where we operate. \\n\\nEthics and compliance policies are  \\nupdated regularly to reflect regulatory and \\nindustry changes.\\n\\nProcesses for Reporting Concerns \\nOur code emphasizes employees’ \\nresponsibility to report concerns of \\nnoncompliance, including those related to \\nworkplace discrimination or harassment. \\nTo promote this, we strive to create an \\nenvironment where they feel safe to do so \\n\\nGlobal Ethics and Compliance Program\\n\\nClear leadership \\nand accountability\\n\\nWritten standards \\nof conduct \\n\\nProcesses for \\nreporting concerns\\n\\nRigorous auditing \\nand monitoring\\n\\nProcesses for \\ninvestigations and \\ncorrective actions\\n\\nRisk assessments \\nto enhance \\ncompliance\\n\\nCompany-wide \\ntraining and \\ncommunications\\n\\nwithout fear of retaliation. We have defined \\navenues and processes for asking questions \\nand reporting suspected or actual violations of \\nour code, policies or procedures. This includes \\nour Speak Up tool, through which employees \\nand external parties, including suppliers, \\ncan confidentially and — where permitted — \\nanonymously raise concerns of potential \\nmisconduct. Speak Up can be accessed by \\ntelephone, email or internet 24 hours a day, \\nseven days a week. Live Speak Up telephone \\nsupport includes operators who speak \\nmultiple languages for non-English speakers. \\nEmployees may also contact the OEC, Legal or \\nthe CECO directly.\\n\\nEach report is entered into a database by the \\nEthics and Compliance Officer or delegated \\nvendor or personnel. These are then \\ninvestigated by the appropriate function so the \\nOEC can determine if any action is needed. \\nPeriodic audits of this process help ensure we \\nare conducting investigations as quickly and \\nthoroughly as possible. \\n\\nOur Employee Problem Solving policy \\nprovides a system for openly exchanging \\ninformation and resolving concerns. It applies \\nto all Abbott employees worldwide, except \\nwhere local laws or collective bargaining \\nagreements dictate otherwise. \\n\\n79\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nRigorous Auditing and Monitoring \\nOur international audit and monitoring \\nprocess assesses compliance with our \\ncode, policies and procedures. Assessments \\ndetermine the frequency and scope of audits. \\nWe maintain a tracking system for all action \\nitems identified to ensure business leaders are \\nheld accountable for making any necessary \\nimprovements to processes in a timely manner. \\n\\nThe OEC monitors business activities \\nthroughout the year. OEC personnel \\nsupporting each Abbott business unit and \\ncountry perform an annual risk assessment \\nto identify areas of potential compliance risk. \\nBased on assessment outcomes, they then \\nestablish monitoring plans for the year. \\n\\nOur monitoring includes selecting a risk-based \\nsampling of interactions with healthcare \\nproviders (HCPs) (such as educational events, \\nengagements with HCPs for services, and \\nprovision of sample or evaluation product) and \\nreviewing supporting documentation to assess \\ncompliance with Abbott’s policies. \\n\\nThe OEC also conducts “live monitoring” \\nprograms through which personnel directly \\nobserve HCP interactions. Issues detected \\nthrough monitoring are analyzed, investigated \\n\\nif necessary and reported to management. \\nMonitoring data are analyzed and trended over \\ntime to identify potential patterns requiring \\nfurther evaluation. The OEC assigns and tracks \\nto completion remedial actions, addressing the \\nroot causes of monitoring findings. \\n\\nProcesses for Investigations and  \\nCorrective Actions \\nAll reports of potential code violations — \\nincluding those related to discrimination and \\nharassment — by employees and third parties \\nthat perform certain services on our behalf \\nare thoroughly investigated. Where necessary, \\ncorrective actions are taken. Any employee \\nwho violates our code, policies or procedures \\nis subject to appropriate disciplinary action, \\nwhich may include termination. Employees \\nrefusing to cooperate in an investigation —  \\nor anyone who knowingly reports a false \\nconcern, or one intended to threaten, \\nintimidate or retaliate — may also be subject  \\nto disciplinary action. \\n\\nAbbott does not tolerate retaliation against \\nwhistleblowers, or anyone else who reports \\na violation in good faith. This foundational \\nprinciple is embedded in several sections \\nof our Code of Business Conduct, which \\n\\nemployees are required to certify their \\nadherence to annually. Our training courses \\non the Code of Business Conduct and Decision \\nMaking at Abbott also make reference to \\nAbbott’s stance on no retaliation. Anti-\\nretaliation language is also included in our \\nGlobal Compliance Policy on Reporting \\nConcerns and our Global Compliance \\nStandards. Anti-retaliation principles are also \\na key component in several human resource \\npolicies, including Employee Problem Solving, \\nWorkplace Harassment and Violence in the \\nWorkplace. Abbott’s Speak-Up platform, \\nwhere employees and third parties can raise \\npotential concerns, includes a message from \\nAbbott’s CECO that Abbott does not tolerate \\nretaliation against those who report concerns. \\n\\nIn addition, Abbott encourages employees to \\nreport any instances of retaliation, separately \\ninvestigates those reports and disciplines \\nemployees who have engaged in retaliation. \\nCorrective action related to Code violations, \\nincluding retaliation, may involve disciplinary \\naction up to and including termination.\\n\\n80\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nCorruption and Anti-Bribery \\n\\nAs a global healthcare company, we work \\nand interact with thousands of people \\nevery day.

In 2021, we removed \\n16,692 marketplaces, apps, websites and social \\nmedia sites selling counterfeit, diverted, \\noutdated and stolen products, and 218,128 \\nindividual product listings. \\n\\nSAFEGUARDING  \\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\\nThe following steps safeguard Abbott’s \\nintellectual property and trade secrets against \\ninternational threats: \\n\\n• •  Educating employees on trade secret \\n\\nprotection and risk-reduction strategies\\n\\n• •  Conducting Security Quality Reviews \\n\\n(SQRs) to identify critical asset risks and \\ndeveloping mitigation strategies \\n\\n• •  Supporting BUs to develop risk-mitigation \\n\\nprograms that comply with external and \\ninternal governance\\n\\nThroughout 2021, we continued to harness \\na virtual Security Quality Review (vSQR) \\nprocess we developed in 2020, completing \\naround 70 reviews of cross-business risks. Our \\nGlobal Security team launched training for all \\ncore businesses, addressing topics related to \\nInterconnected Security Services (ISS) while a \\nnew Technical Surveillance Countermeasures \\n(TSCM) program is enhancing security \\nmeasures for key sites. \\n\\nPROTECTING OUR EMPLOYEES\\nGlobal Communications Center (GCC) analysts \\nmonitor world events, providing advance \\nwarning of emerging threats and ensuring \\nemployees are safe and accounted for. Situational \\nAwareness For Everyone Everywhere (SAFEE) \\ntraining bolsters security awareness. In 2021, \\nour Global Security team provided training, \\nincluding SAFEE, to 17,000 employees. \\n\\nRegional security experts and our Travel \\nSafety program protect employees traveling \\nfor work. In 2021, the program supported \\n28,000 travelers.\\n\\nSECURING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN\\nWe are committed to eliminating criminal \\nactivities, including drug trafficking, terrorism, \\nhuman trafficking, forced child labor, cyber \\nthreats and illegal contraband from our supply \\nchain. We comply with all international \\ncustoms laws, and carefully choose our \\npartners to prevent unethical practices and \\nsecurity threats. \\n\\nOur efforts exceed U.S. Customs and Border \\nProtection (CBP) enhanced Customs Trade \\nPartnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) \\nMinimum Security Criteria (MSC). We \\npartner with CBP and an external vendor on \\na surveillance system that mitigates theft, \\ncounterfeiting and illegal diversion risks. \\nAdditionally, we remain a Tier 3 CTPAT \\npartner, enabling movement of products in \\nand out of the U.S. with expedited processing \\nand 80% fewer customs exams. Many Abbott \\nbusinesses also participate in the Authorized \\nEconomic Operator program. \\n\\nA Strategic Approach  \\nto Product and Brand \\nProtection\\nOur enforcement program is built on \\nindustry best practices and ensures \\nwe address the most significant risks. \\nEnforcement tactics include:\\n• •  Covert market surveys\\n• •  Removing counterfeit products \\n\\nand\\xa0sites \\n\\n• •  Halting sale of \\n\\nunauthorized\\xa0products \\n\\n• •  Providing contract security \\n\\nlanguage and enforcing policies \\nwith authorized resellers\\nIdentifying and removing illicit \\nactors via paid searches\\n• •  Reporting fake social \\n\\n• • \\n\\nmedia\\xa0accounts \\n\\n• •  Eliminating illegitimate and \\n\\ncybersquatted sites that could \\nharm the Abbott brand \\n\\n83\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nSecuring Our BinaxNOW Supply Chain \\nEnsuring customers always receive legitimate Abbott \\ngoods requires that we track our products at every \\nstep of the value chain. \\nThroughout 2021, we performed robust supply chain \\nrisk management processes for our BinaxNOW tests. \\nThis included securing over 8,000 shipments to \\nsuccessfully deliver almost 1 billion tests. To prevent \\nfraudulent sales, we removed 70,000 listings selling \\nillicit tests on e-commerce sites. We also partnered \\nwith eBay to ensure all test kits were automatically \\ndetected and taken down. \\nThese steps helped guarantee that the products \\ncustomers received were legitimate, safe and \\neffective, and prevented $4.6 million in losses \\nfor\\xa0Abbott. \\n\\n84\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nU.S. TRADE ORGANIZATIONS \\nWe are a member of various U.S. trade \\norganizations that engage in lobbying and \\nother political activity to champion our \\nneeds, those of our industry and those of the \\npeople who rely on Abbott solutions.

We report data from \\nacquisitions as soon as is practical. To that end, this data includes the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical, Glomed and Alere Inc. Furthermore, this data \\nreflects the divestiture of Abbott Medical Optics.\\n(a)  Abbott Fund\\n(b)  2021 marked the first year of our enhanced employee giving program. See page 35.\\n(c) \\n(d)  This includes Alere employees.\\n(e)   Legacy Alere is included in Health and Safety and Scope 3 metrics beginning in 2019. 2018 metrics do not include legacy\\xa0Alere.\\n(f) \\n\\n These percentages are as of December 31, 2020. Percentages represent a count of U.S. employees, excluding the rapid diagnostics\\xa0business.\\n\\n Annual incident rates are calculated per 100 employees, assuming the average employee works 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. This is \\nequivalent to 200,000 hours worked.\\n\\n(g)  This change represents 2021 progress toward our 2030 Goal of 30% reduction from 2018.\\n(h)  This is the percentage change from 2020 to 2021. \\n(i)  This is the baseline year.\\n(j)  Progress toward 2030 carbon goal is reported using the GHGP Scope 2 market-based methodology.\\n(k)   Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the GHGP market-based methodology. Per the GHGP, where market-based information is not available, \\n\\nlocation-based results have been used as proxy.\\n Reported Purchased Fuels Scope 1 sources consist of fuel consumed by manufacturing, R&D and warehouse facilities under Abbott’s control; sales \\nfleet; and Abbott-owned aviation.\\n\\n(l) \\n\\n(o)   Abbott’s nonenergy-consumption greenhouse gas emissions, such as refrigerant releases and process air emissions, are omitted. The total CO2 \\n\\nequivalents from nonenergy sources are noted in the Total Emissions (Scope 1 and 2) table.\\n\\n(p)   All Scope 3 calculations are adjusted to account for updated spend metrics. Sourcing category spend allocations are subject to change year over year \\n\\nin alignment with business strategy. Legacy Alere included in metrics beginning in 2019. 2018 metrics do not include legacy Alere.\\n\\n(q)  This reflects emissions from fuel combusted by manufacturing, R&D and warehouse facilities under Abbott’s control.\\n(r) \\n\\n Water-stressed locations have been determined using the WRI Aqueduct™ global water risk mapping tool. Sites rated as having high or extremely \\nhigh baseline water stress in the tool are classified as being water stressed.\\n\\n(s)  Water withdrawal is equivalent to water intake.\\n(t) \\n\\n Abbott’s diversion rate is calculated as follows: (Total Waste + Beneficial Use - Landfilled and Incineration without Energy Recovery)/Total Waste + \\nBeneficial Use. Commercial and other building activities, specific to beneficial use, are included in this rate starting in 2019.\\n\\n(u)   In 2018, data represents manufacturing, R&D and warehouse facilities under Abbott’s control. Nonmanufacturing data was not collected prior  \\n\\nto 2019.\\n\\n(v)  Waste-generation data does not include materials that are reused beneficially.\\n(w)   Abbott defines beneficial-use activities as sending material that otherwise would have been wasted off site to be used as an effective substitute for a \\n\\ncommercial product or commodity. Beneficial-use material is used as is or in substantially the same form as it was\\xa0generated.\\n The definition of “government agency inspection” was updated in 2017 by Abbott to include routine visits and sample collection from regulatory \\nagencies or designated representatives. \\n\\n(x) \\n\\n(m) Per the GHGP, Scope 1 Refrigerant CO2e emissions include only those covered in the Kyoto Protocol.\\n(n)   Reported Scope 2 sources consist of energy directly purchased by Abbott, such as electricity, steam, and hot and chilled water, as well as emissions \\n\\nfrom leased locations. Unless specified otherwise, emissions are calculated according to the GHGP Scope 2 location-based method.\\n\\n114\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index \\n\\nWe sought to prepare this report in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. \\nLinks to relevant sections in our reports and websites are included in the table below.\\n\\n2016 GRI Standard\\nGeneral Disclosures\\n2-1 \\nGRI 2:  \\nGeneral \\nDisclosures  \\n2021 \\n\\n2-2 \\n\\n2-3\\n\\n2-4 \\n2-5 \\n\\n2-6 \\n\\n2-7 \\n2-8\\n\\n2-9 \\n\\n2-10\\n\\n2-11\\n\\nGRI Disclosure\\n\\nLocation\\n\\nOrganizational details\\n\\nEntities included in \\nthe organization’s \\nsustainability\\xa0reporting \\nReporting period, frequency \\nand contact point \\n\\nhttps://www.abbott.com/contact.html\\nhttps://www.abbott.com/global-locations-contacts.html\\nForm 10-K, page 20\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Appendix, page 87\\n\\nJanuary 1–December 31, 2021\\nresponsibility@abbott.com\\n\\nRestatements of information Global Sustainability Report 2021: Metrics Endnotes, page 114\\nExternal assurance\\n\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: ESG Appendix, External Assurance, page 87\\nWe verify our EHS performance data using an independent assurance provider: Apex \\nCompanies (formerly Bureau Veritas North America).\\nAt a Glance\\nGlobal Locations & Contacts\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: About Abbott, page 7\\nForm 10-K: page 78\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Our Purpose in Action, page 4\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: ESG Appendix, Key Social Metrics, page 91\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Build the Diverse, Innovative Workforce of Tomorrow, \\npage\\xa029\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Sustainability in Everything We Do, page 14\\nProxy Statement: The Board of Directors and its Committees, pages 16–27\\nBoard of Directors & Committees\\nBoard of Directors & Committees\\nProxy Statement: The Board of Directors and its Committees, pages 16–27\\nBoard of Directors & Committees\\nProxy Statement: The Board of Directors and its Committees, pages 16–27\\n\\nActivities, value chain and \\nother business relationships \\n\\nEmployees\\nWorkers who are \\nnot\\xa0employees\\nGovernance structure \\nand\\xa0composition\\n\\nNomination and selection of \\nthe highest governance\\xa0body\\n\\nChair of the highest \\ngovernance body\\n\\n2016 GRI Standard\\nGRI 2:  \\nGeneral \\nDisclosures  \\n2021\\n\\n2-12 \\n\\nGRI Disclosure\\nRole of the highest \\ngovernance body in \\noverseeing the management \\nof impacts\\n\\n2-13 \\n\\n2-14 \\n\\n2-15 \\n2-16\\n\\n2-17\\n\\n2-18\\n\\n2-19 \\n\\n2-20\\n\\n2-21\\n\\nDelegation of responsibility \\nfor managing impacts\\n\\nDelegation of responsibility \\nfor managing impacts\\nConflicts of interest\\nCommunication of \\ncritical\\xa0concerns \\n\\nCollective knowledge of the \\nhighest governance body \\n\\nEvaluation of the \\nperformance of the highest \\ngovernance body\\nRemuneration policies\\n\\nProcess to determine \\nremuneration\\n\\nAnnual total \\ncompensation\\xa0ratio\\n\\nLocation\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: ESG Appendix, Materiality, page 88\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: ESG Appendix, Stakeholder Engagement, page 89\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Sustainability in Everything We Do, page 14\\nProxy Statement: The Board of Directors and its Committees, pages 16–27\\nCDP Climate Change Response: (C1.2a)\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Sustainability in Everything We Do, page 14\\nProxy Statement: The Board of Directors and its Committees, pages 16–27\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Governance and Sustainability Foundations, page 74\\n\\nGovernance Guidelines webpage: Director Responsibilities and Code of Business Conduct\\nProxy Statement: The Board of Directors and its Committees, pages 16–27\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Processes for Reporting Concerns, page 79\\nDue to confidentiality constraints, Abbott does not report the total number and nature \\nof critical concerns.

We aim to reach as many people as possible who need these healthcare solutions. \\nAs part of our 2030 Sustainability Plan, we have an intentional focus on designing sustainable access and \\naffordability into our new life-changing technologies so that we can make them widely available at affordable prices \\nto people who need them. Pricing, however, is only one of the factors that determine affordability. Abbott also \\nis advocating for systems and approaches that broaden access while minimizing additional costs for consumers \\nand\\xa0payers. \\nIn 2021, Abbott’s product pricing reflected the company’s approach, with an annual global net sales price change of \\n-1.5%, which compares to a Global Consumer Price Index (CPI) of +3.9% for 2021. This metric is modified from the \\nmetric provided by SASB by substituting a global CPI for the U.S. CPI. \\nSales outside of the U.S. in 2021 comprised approximately 61% of Abbott’s revenue. Abbott believes that disclosing \\nproduct pricing relative to the Global CPI is an appropriate way for investors and other stakeholders to best \\nunderstand pricing for products across our diversified, global businesses. The global CPI is the total headline CPI for \\neach country weighted by Abbott’s geographic revenue exposure. For more on Abbott pricing, see Abbott’s 10-K \\nfiling for 2021.\\n\\n2021 Disclosure \\nAbbott Laboratories sells diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. (For \\nmore details, see page 20 in our Innovate for Access and Affordability section in this report.) Given the breadth of \\nour product offerings, each Abbott division sells products using a variety of contracting methodologies. Divisions \\nuse a variety of price concessions in their sales contracting, including point-of-sale discounts, rebates and wholesaler \\nchargebacks. These price concessions can be for single or multi-product sales and may include products from \\nmultiple business units or divisions (such as all medical device business units or rapid and molecular diagnostics). \\nPrice concessions may be based upon factors such as volume, market share and purchase commitments, or result \\nfrom competitive bidding processes, and are generally documented in executed contracts, purchase orders and \\nterm sheets. Point-of-sale discounts are reflected in invoices that show the discounted prices, and rebates are \\ndocumented in written agreements, with rebate calculations provided at the time rebate payments are made. \\nOur customers span the globe and include federal, state and local governments, hospitals, group purchasing \\norganizations, wholesalers, individual healthcare providers and consumers. We maintain pricing flexibility to meet the \\nneeds of our diverse customers, large and small, and to ensure that our essential healthcare products are available \\nand affordable across the globe.\\n\\nProduct Safety\\nHC-MS-250a.1: Number of \\nrecalls issued, total units recalled.\\n\\nBusiness \\nMed Device\\nDiagnostics\\nPharmaceutical2\\nNutrition\\n\\nFDA Class I and Class II \\n\\nClass I\\n1\\n1\\nN/A\\n0\\n\\nClass II\\n3\\n6\\nN/A\\n0\\n\\n124\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (SASB) INDEX CONTINUED\\n\\nMetric\\nHC-MS-250a.2: List of products \\nlisted in the FDA’s MedWatch \\nSafety Alerts for Human Medical \\nProducts database.\\n\\nHC-MS-250a.3: Number of \\nfatalities related to products \\nas reported in the FDA \\nManufacturer and User Facility \\nDevice Experience database.\\n\\nHC-MS-250a.4: Number \\nof FDA enforcement actions \\ntaken in response to violations \\nof current Good Manufacturing \\nPractices (cGMP), by type.\\n\\n2021 Disclosure \\nSee the FDA’s MedWatch safety alerts for human medical products database. \\n•  Potential for False Positive Results with Abbott Molecular Inc.

In 2021, our Nutrition business (1) utilized 138,000 U.S. tons of material to place 3.7 billion packages \\non market, (2) made 19% of packaging from recycled and/or renewable materials and (3) estimated that 65% of its \\npackaging is recyclable, reusable and/or compostable.\\n\\nWe recognize the impact our packaging has on the environment today in the form of resource use, related emissions \\nand waste production. We are rethinking how we design packaging to optimize material use and keep materials in \\ncirculation for as long as possible. To reduce raw material burden, we are optimizing efficiency by minimizing the \\nvolume and weight of our packaging. We are also employing circularity principles to incorporate increased quantities \\nof recycled content and designing for recyclability, reusability and increasingly positive impact. \\nTo address 50 million pounds of packaging through high-impact sustainable design programs, we need a plan of \\naction.

We maintain an identification process for opportunities to address emerging climate change-\\nrelated healthcare needs and increase operating efficiencies by reducing climate-related impacts. We have determined that \\nclimate-related risks and opportunities exist at site and regional levels but are limited at a global scale. \\n\\nRISKS\\nWe analyze physical and transitional risks resulting from emerging regulation and new supplier/customer expectations \\nof our businesses and risk exposure. We assess and manage them through our integrated company-wide risk management \\nprocess, which identifies opportunities to build resilience in both our operations and our business model. We regularly \\nupdate risk management policies, standards and programs to align with global best practices and regulatory requirements, \\nand aim to anticipate emerging risks and upcoming regulatory changes. Our enterprise risk management (ERM) \\nprocess identifies and evaluates the most critical business risks and provides guidance to our Board of Directors and \\nmanagement team. \\n\\nThe EHS Governance team monitors emerging climate-related trends and regulations to analyze potential impacts and \\nrisk exposure, and develop appropriate management strategies. Our EHS, Economics, Business Continuity and Supply \\nChain organizations use scenario-sensitivity risk modeling to understand the financial implications of climate-related risks. \\nAbbott’s Business Continuity and Crisis Management organizations implement measures to ensure business continuity \\nand minimize the financial impacts of physical climate-related risks. These physical risks fall into two categories: acute \\nand chronic. \\n\\n• • \\n\\n  Acute physical risks associated with climate change include unforeseen extreme weather events for which we cannot \\ndevelop preventative strategies. We have developed strategies for mitigating and responding to them across our value \\nchain. Our Business Continuity and Crisis Management organization works with our EHS, Engineering and Supply \\nChain groups to strengthen business resiliency against weather events and other forms of extreme disruption. During \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and strict travel restrictions, our processes enabled us to quickly produce millions of COVID-19 \\ntests while continuing to provide our other essential products to people globally.\\n\\n• • \\n\\n  Our Engineering and EHS policies and management standards consider chronic physical risks, such as water scarcity, \\nand require sites to conduct regular risk and opportunity evaluations and implement mitigation strategies. \\n\\nClimate-related risk analyses conclude that Abbott is not exposed to physical risks that could generate a substantive change \\nin business operations, revenue or expenditure at a corporate level. While limited physical risks exist at site and regional \\noperation levels and throughout our supply chain, our diverse geographical distribution significantly mitigates the potential \\nfor substantive business impact.\\n\\nOur most significant climate-related risks are transition risks that relate to emerging expectations and regulations around \\nGHG emission management. These include carbon limits and taxes, enhanced reporting obligations, costs to transition to \\nlower-emissions technologies, and increased costs of goods and services. We have identified the need to manage and mitigate \\nenvironmental impacts as a potential enterprise risk. In response to this, our business strategy includes reducing operational \\nenergy and carbon footprint, and engaging our value chain in strategic sourcing categories.\\n\\nOPPORTUNITIES\\nAs part of our product research and development (R&D) and climate risk management processes, we consider climate \\nchange-related opportunities. These fall into two main categories: \\n\\n• •  Increased operating efficiencies through achieving carbon reduction targets \\n\\n• • \\n\\n The opportunity to advance our mission to help people live their best lives by meeting changing healthcare and \\nnutrition needs\\n\\n130\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nTASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD) RESPONSE CONTINUED\\n\\nCompared with many industries, Abbott’s carbon footprint is relatively small, reducing opportunities to achieve significant \\nimprovements in operating efficiencies and cost savings.

When adjusted for sales, Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased 17% over \\nthis same time period. In 2021, as our products — including COVID testing and \\ndiagnostics — became increasingly important for patients and healthcare workers \\nglobally, we expanded production, which has come with a rise in emissions. \\n\\nEnergy Efficiency\\nTo reduce energy demand, we have made several energy-efficient improvements \\nas retrofits to existing equipment or through active in-house energy management. \\nSeveral sites use energy data and innovative methods to identify and quantify \\nenergy inefficiencies in manufacturing processes, often employing external experts. \\nThese insights then inform a list of priority energy demand reduction projects \\nacross the global business. For example, in Indonesia, many of our motors have \\nbeen upgraded with variable speed drives, reducing energy requirements while \\nretaining performance.\\n\\nRenewable Energy \\nWe are committed to purchasing a greater proportion of electricity from renewable \\nsources and are developing a Renewable Energy Procurement initiative to drive \\ncontinuous improvement in this area. In 2021, we purchased 190 million kWh of \\nlow-carbon and renewable energy, resulting in savings of 80,000 metric tons of \\nCO2e. In addition, we also generated 1.8 million kWh from solar installations at eight \\nof our sites. \\n\\nSee page 45 of Abbott’s Environment section for more information on our 2021 \\nprogress for climate action and our latest CDP Climate Change response. \\n\\n140\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDG) INDEX CONTINUED\\n\\nPARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS\\nSTRENGTHEN THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION \\nAND REVITALIZE THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP \\nFOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\\n\\nTARGET\\n\\n17.6 / 17.17\\n\\nWHY IT MATTERS\\n\\nCollaboration is key to mitigating shared impacts.

That’s because we’ve long \\nunderstood that the key to sustaining our \\nenterprise is a willingness to evolve it, to \\nanticipate changes in the environment and to \\nadapt Abbott in ways that make us best able to \\nachieve our fundamental purpose — helping \\npeople live healthier, fuller lives. \\n\\nWe’ve amply demonstrated that ability \\nthroughout our history, strategically \\nreshaping Abbott to become one of the \\nworld’s leading health technology companies, \\nwith a broad portfolio and global reach that \\nlet us help more people than ever before.\\n\\nThe past few years have been among the \\nmost challenging in our lifetimes, but they’ve \\nalso highlighted for us the critical nature of \\nthe work we do and the significant positive \\nimpact we can have for patients and for the \\ncommunities in which we operate. \\n\\nBut we know that if we want to sustain that \\nimpact in a changing world, we can’t rely \\non the same playbooks we’ve used before. \\nSo, incorporating input from internal and \\n\\nexternal stakeholders, we developed a 10-year \\nplan to identify the areas we need to focus on \\nin order to grow sustainably.\\n\\nCentral to this plan is the idea that we can do \\nthe most good by pursuing our fundamental \\nmission as a company: bringing life-changing \\ntechnologies and products to the people and \\nplaces that need them. That’s why we’re \\nbuilding affordability into our products to \\nincrease access to them, and breaking down \\nbarriers that prevent people from getting \\nthe care they need. And to support that \\ncore purpose, we’ve set ourselves ambitious \\ngoals in key areas that strengthen our \\nfoundation for the future, including building \\nthe workforce of tomorrow, responsibly \\napplying data to advance care, building a \\nmore resilient, diverse and responsible supply \\nchain, and protecting health by safeguarding \\nthe environment.\\n\\nThis report is the first to detail the progress \\nwe’ve made on these 2030 goals and, as you’ll \\nread, we’re making real strides in all of these \\nareas. We’re setting the foundation for our \\nlong-term success, but we’re also remaining \\nresponsive to the pressing issues of today.\\n\\nFor example, our contributions to the fight \\nagainst COVID-19 remained important and \\nimpactful (see page 6). We also stepped up \\nin a variety of ways in response to the crisis \\nin Ukraine, donating $6 million in funding \\nand much-needed products to rebuild \\ncritical healthcare infrastructure and deliver \\nemergency and primary healthcare services \\nand supplies, working with humanitarian \\norganizations including International \\nMedical Corps, Americares, CARE and  \\nProject HOPE.\\n\\nThe values that drove those actions were \\nalso in evidence in our decision, in 2022, \\nto recall infant formula produced at one of \\nour U.S. plants (see page 60). Our people \\nare committed to our Customer Pledge to \\nmake our products as if they’re for our own \\nfamilies; and we’ll be redoubling our efforts – \\nacross every business, across every part of the \\nglobe – to ensure that our long-established \\nreputation for excellence and the highest \\nproduct quality will remain our bedrock. \\n\\nAt Abbott, we’re in the business of making \\npeople’s lives better, and we manage all \\naspects of the company to ensure we’ll \\nbe doing that for decades to come. Our \\nfundamental goal is simple: we are working \\nfor a world with fewer barriers — one that \\nenables people to live their fullest possible \\nlives — creating healthier people, healthier \\ncommunities and a healthier world.\\n\\nSincerely, \\n\\nRobert B.

It also puts forward \\nnominations for Abbott’s Volwiler Society, \\nan organization we established in 1985 to \\nrecognize, support and celebrate our most \\ndistinguished scientists and engineers for \\ncreating breakthrough technologies that \\nchange millions of lives around the world. \\n\\nNominees must meet rigorous criteria  \\nand demonstrate a history of consistent \\nscientific and technical contributions.  \\nHaving a program like this in place is \\ntestament to the importance Abbott places \\non innovation.\\n\\nToday, the Volwiler Society has 125 members, \\nseveral of whom are also members of \\nthe American Institute for Medical and \\nBiological Engineering (AIMBE) — a \\nnonprofit organization representing the most \\naccomplished individuals in these fields. \\n\\nThe AIMBE brings together over 1,500 people \\nfrom academia, industry, government and \\nscientific societies to create an influential \\nnetwork of experts committed to advancing \\nmedical and biological engineering for the \\ngood of society.\\n\\nScott Muerhoff, a Distinguished Research Fellow \\nin Abbott’s Volwiler Society, drove development \\nof the biologics for Abbott’s COVID-19 serology \\nportfolio, contributing to four important assays, \\nincluding the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test.\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nInnovating for Impact\\n\\nBy 2030, we plan to improve the lives \\nof one in every three people a year, \\nproviding increasingly accessible \\nsolutions and delivering more to under-\\nresourced areas. \\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nIn 2021, Abbott products made a difference in \\nthe lives of more than 2.2 billion people, and \\nthe Abbott Fund worked with 62 partners in \\n245 sites to serve nearly 633,000 people.2\\n\\nPartnering to Boost Participation\\nGlobally, the number of young people donating \\nblood is on the decline. To address this trend, in \\n2015, we launched BE THE 1 — the first global \\nrecruitment movement focusing on expanding \\nthe pool of young donors. Since then, more than \\n100 blood and plasma centers have embraced \\nthe campaign and donations have increased as \\nmuch as 37% in certain countries. \\n\\n2 Figure is inclusive of all people served by the Abbott Fund, covering \\nhealth access, disaster relief and Future Well Kids.\\n3 https://www.diabetes.org/healthequitynow\\n\\nIn 2021, we launched “Give Blood. Get Back,” \\na campaign that reached more than 50 million \\npeople in the U.S. As part of this program, \\nwe engaged 15 influencers on TikTok and \\nInstagram, and included a licensed song \\nand TikTok dance challenge, achieving \\nunprecedented positive response and Gen Z/\\nMillennial engagement. Less than 48 hours \\nafter launch, more than 2,000 people accessed \\nthe website to find a location to donate with a \\n40% click-through rate.\\n\\nInclusive Clinical Trial Representation \\nWe believe data collected in clinical trials should \\nbe representative of the people our products \\nare intended to serve. But today, while people \\nof diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds \\nmake up nearly 40% of the U.S. population, and \\nare disproportionately impacted by chronic \\nconditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular \\ndisease, they are still heavily underrepresented \\nin the clinical trials process. To help address \\nthe disparities that exist in clinical trials, \\nwe’re developing an outreach plan to build \\ntrust in areas where trial participants haven’t \\ntraditionally been included. We want to work \\nwith others who recognize the need to overcome \\nfour substantial barriers to diverse participation \\nin clinical trials:\\n\\n• •  Lack of access to facilities, trials and/or \\n\\nresources in the area\\n\\n• •  Lack of understanding on the benefits to \\nself or community through participation\\n\\n• •  Lack of trust in institutions or individuals \\n\\ndue to prior bad experiences\\n\\n• •  Lack of clarity across languages\\n\\nPart of our outreach includes forming an \\nadvisory board, with the goal of determining \\nhow best to increase participation across gender \\nand ethnic lines. Some of the ways we plan to \\novercome these barriers and progress in this \\narea include:\\n\\n• •  Recruiting, training, developing and \\n\\ncoaching women and ethnically diverse \\ndoctors who reflect their communities and \\nare interested in clinical trials\\n\\n• •  Committing $5 million to fund nearly 300 \\n\\nscholarships through new partnerships \\nwith medical schools at Historically Black \\nColleges and Universities (HBCUs) and \\nminority nursing associations, with the goal \\nof producing more racially and ethnically \\ndiverse nurses and trialists who, if given the \\nopportunity, will dramatically impact trials \\nin the future\\n\\n• •  Expanding clinical trials into new \\nsites in more communities to reach \\nunderrepresented patients\\n\\n• •  Connecting with diverse participants and \\n\\ncultivating trust and education through the \\nuse of culturally appropriate materials\\n\\nBy expanding the reach of studies to include \\ndiverse groups, we can achieve a clearer \\nimage of our products’ impacts in real-world \\nsituations. Armed with this information, we can \\ncontinue to develop solutions that help even \\nmore people. \\n\\nWhen we initiated our LIFE-BTK study \\non a treatment for people with advanced \\nperipheral artery disease (PAD), we \\nestablished a diverse team of investigators \\nand performed trials across several locations \\nto reach underrepresented demographics. \\nPartnerships with institutes like the Women \\nas One physician organization helped further \\ndiversify the process. Similarly, our Beyond \\nIntervention research gathered insights from \\nover 1,800 people across 13 countries to create \\na more complete picture of how technology \\ncan improve the care of patients with \\nvascular disease. \\n\\nINCREASING ACCESS TO  \\nDIABETES CARE \\nThe Health Equity Bill of Rights\\xa0— \\nestablished by the American Diabetes \\nAssociation\\xa0— posits 10 basic rights for \\npeople with diabetes and prediabetes. \\nWe have sponsored a pilot initiative \\ndesigned by the association to address \\nright #9:\\nThe right to the latest medical advances\\nToday, Black Americans are 60%3 more \\nlikely to be diagnosed with diabetes, yet \\nmuch less likely to have their condition \\nwell managed. The goal of our three-\\nyear, $5\\xa0million effort is to reduce health \\ninequities by removing barriers to tools \\nand technology for diabetes management, \\nregardless of income level or insurance \\nstatus. The pilot seeks to better understand \\nand address the healthcare disparities for \\nBlack people living with diabetes. Focusing \\ninitial efforts in Columbus, Ohio, we will \\nhelp by sponsoring campaigns to enhance \\nawareness, access to and adoption of these \\ntools. In collaboration with the National \\nCenter for Urban Solutions (NCUS), \\n150 Black residents living with diabetes \\nwill have access to health education, \\nphysical training, nutritional support and \\nAbbott’s FreeStyle Libre flash glucose \\nmonitoring\\xa0technology.\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nInnovating to Improve Health Outcomes\\n\\nWe are continuously exploring how we \\ncan help people live longer and better, \\nfinding measurable ways to address social \\nchallenges and improve health outcomes \\nwith scientific and technical expertise. \\n\\nPartnering for Better Outcomes \\nIn addition to ensuring our solutions deliver \\nthe best care possible, we work with others \\nto magnify and enhance the outcomes of our \\nefforts. For example, we have partnered with \\nthe Tanzanian government for more than \\n20 years to drive sustainable improvements \\nto the country’s healthcare system, delivering \\nemergency care to more than 1 million patients \\nto date.\\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nProactively Addressing Pandemic Threats \\nIn 2020, building on our decades-long \\nexperience in viral surveillance, we established \\nthe Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition to help \\nidentify new pathogens, analyze potential risk \\nlevels, develop and deploy diagnostic testing \\nand assess public health impacts. Throughout \\n2021, we expanded the coalition, leveraging \\nthe expertise of global centers of excellence \\nin laboratory testing, genetic sequencing \\nand public health research to respond to the \\nemergence of the COVID-19 Omicron variant. \\nFourteen cross-continent sites, including \\nAbbott, contributed to this research. \\n\\nWe partnered with The Task Force for Global \\nHealth on a first-of-its-kind field program to \\ntrain the next generation of epidemiologists. \\nAdditionally, a virology fellowship with the \\nGlobal Virus Network will help develop  \\nfuture virologists. \\n\\nImproving Outcomes With Ultreon \\nWe aim to improve outcomes for 1 million \\npatients annually using our Ultreon software to \\noptimize percutaneous coronary intervention \\n(PCI)4 by 2030. In 2021, we began the rollout \\nof Ultreon 1.0 software, which merges imaging \\ntechnology with artificial intelligence to \\nenhance visualization of PCI procedures. \\nThe software can automatically detect \\nblockage severity and measure blood vessel \\ncharacteristics, supporting more precise \\ndecisions. The game-changing capabilities \\nof this software resulted in Ultreon 1.0 \\nreceiving honoree recognition at the CES 2022 \\nInnovation Awards. \\n\\nUltreon 1.0 represents the first of several \\nsuch platforms. The data we’re collecting \\nfrom it are already informing development of \\nUltreon\\xa02.0 — a system that will be accessible \\nto smaller centers, improving outcomes for a \\ngrowing number of patients. \\n\\nSCORING BIG FOR KIDS’ HEALTH\\nIn 2021, we entered into a three-year agreement to be the Health Sciences and \\nNutrition Partner for Real Madrid Football Club. We have also signed on as Global \\nPartner of the Real Madrid Foundation\\xa0— an organization founded by the club to \\npromote the value of sport to children globally. \\nThe partnership will deliver education, sports and social welfare activities to support \\nchildren in under-resourced communities in 80 countries. It will also involve working \\nwith Real Madrid Foundation social sports schools in 12 countries to provide malnutrition \\nscreening, education and nutrition support. Finally, through the agreement,  \\nwe will address nutrition needs through Real Madrid Foundation clinics, which  \\nare hosted in 42 countries.\\n\\n4 PCI is a minimally invasive procedure used to open coronary arteries \\nand restore blood flow. \\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nPricing Discipline to Improve Access\\n\\nHealthcare products are a valuable \\nsocietal investment\\xa0— they enable \\npeople and societies to flourish. We are \\ncommitted to finding innovative ways to \\nimprove efficiency and consumer access \\nto our life-changing products. \\n\\nAffordable Diagnostics \\nOur diagnostics business is always on \\nthe lookout for ways to improve costs by \\nincreasing efficiency in our manufacturing, \\nsupply chain and product support areas. Over \\nthe past four years, we have realized year-over-\\nyear improvements in cost of goods for more \\nthan 80% of products by volume. \\n\\nCost Savings Fund Innovation\\nThroughout 2021, our sites took several steps \\nto improve operational efficiency, resulting in \\ncost savings that help drive our investment in \\ninnovation. For example:\\n\\n• •  In Africa, we launched malaria diagnostic \\ntests with smaller packaging dimensions, \\nreducing required distribution trips and \\nlowering logistics costs by around 28% for \\ncustomers. We also increased accessibility of \\nthese products and helped ensure continuity \\nof supply by combining the supply \\ncapabilities of our manufacturing facility in \\nChina with those of our site in Korea. \\n\\n• •  Additionally, we completed a regulatory \\n\\nsubmission for small-pack HIV diagnostic \\ntests. The suggested reduction in kit \\nbox dimensions will translate into \\napproximately 50% logistics cost savings \\nfor customers as a result of improved \\nshipping efficiency. \\n\\n• •  To enable affordability for the governments \\n\\nand agencies purchasing our Panbio \\nCOVID-19 Antigen Self-Test, we have \\nimproved materials and labor efficiency \\nand have achieved a 32% decrease in \\nmanufacturing costs.\\n\\nAdditionally, the launch of a new diagnostic \\nproduct for traumatic brain injury (TBI) — \\nthe i-STAT Alinity TBI Plasma — will enable \\nconcussion diagnoses through blood tests. \\nThis will reduce the need for expensive \\nCT scans, bringing down overall healthcare \\ncosts following head injuries. \\n\\nVALUE EMBEDDED BY DESIGN \\nOne of Abbott’s Core Design Principles is \\nto optimize the products we create across \\nfour factors: people reached, consumer \\nbenefit, business and societal value. Doing so \\nstarts with understanding the needs of our \\ncustomers\\xa0— from patients and healthcare \\nprofessionals to policymakers and those who \\nfund developments. \\nAn important example of this principle in action \\ncan be found in the Early Value Assessment \\n(EVA) process. Through this process, we help \\nensure the expectations of key stakeholders \\nare upheld even as we target increased access \\nand\\xa0affordability.\\nThrough the EVA, we proactively identify \\nsteps that will drive economic and clinical value \\nfor future products. Recommendations are \\nthen captured during design and development \\nprocesses; in turn, positively impacting future \\nreimbursement, coverage and access for patients.\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nInfrastructure and Transforming \\nStandards of Care \\n\\nWe are building infrastructure, offering \\ntraining and providing resources to \\nhelp decentralize care and transform \\nhealthcare standards in communities \\naround the world. \\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nIn 2021, we extended support to 32 \\nhealthcare centers, including training 2,851 \\nhealthcare workers on decentralized services. \\nWe provided over 705,000 people with \\ndecentralized services globally. \\n\\nThe Abbott Center for  \\nMalnutrition Solutions \\nThe Abbott Center for Malnutrition \\nSolutions — our cross-functional innovation \\nhub — is working to improve identification, \\ntreatment and prevention of malnutrition. \\nExternal partnerships, research, innovation \\nand financial support also contribute to \\ndeveloping accessible, sustainable and locally \\nrelevant options for those most in need. \\n\\nAddressing Gaps in Care \\nIn 2019, we began working with the Rwandan \\nMinistry of Health and the Society for Family \\nHealth Rwanda to build an independent, \\ndecentralized and financially stable health \\nnetwork. Together, we launched second-\\ngeneration health posts to address gaps \\nin primary care and testing for HIV and \\nother infectious diseases, including malaria. \\nThrough December 2021, these posts have \\ntreated approximately 260,000 people.\\n\\nIn certain areas, where the closest existing \\nfacilities were up to three hours away, health \\nposts have increased access to care eightfold \\nand cut travel times to around 17 minutes. \\nSince inception, malaria screenings have risen \\nby 68%, with 21,000 residents treated for \\npositive cases.\\n\\nA recent study determined that most of the \\ncare provided during visits to these posts \\nwould not have occurred without them. The \\nhealth post’s main benefit was a substantial \\nincrease in the use of curative primary care for \\nconditions such as malaria, intestinal parasites \\n\\nand acute respiratory infections. These health \\nposts are also financially stable and will be able \\nto sustainably provide care for local residents. \\nDuring their second year of operation, these \\nposts generated an economic profit of 29%. \\n\\nThe study also demonstrated that access to \\nthese health posts addressed a high demand \\nfor these services in rural Rwanda. As a means \\nto improving the health of Rwanda’s rural \\npopulation, these facilities are both improving \\nequity within Rwanda and providing a \\nroadmap for doing the same globally.\\n\\nTransforming Virus Research  \\nwith Biomarkers \\nWe have launched a hepatitis B virus (HBV) \\nbiomarker program to expand understanding \\nof, and treatment for, patients with chronic \\nHBV. Using HBV RNA and surface antigen \\ntests, we are conducting studies to inform \\nmore effective treatments. While research is \\nongoing, evidence for the value of biomarkers \\nin moderating patient care has already been \\nshared in 14 publications. \\n\\nDIAGNOSTIC PANELS FOR \\nENHANCED\\xa0TREATMENT\\nA diagnostic panel is a predetermined \\ngroup of medical tests used in the diagnosis \\nand treatment of disease. Panels support \\ndevelopment of more effective treatments.  \\nIn 2021, we launched, or set the groundwork  \\nfor, three targeted panels. \\n• • \\n\\n Antenatal Care (ANC) Panel: established  \\nto improve lives and reduce mortality for  \\nthe 20 million mothers and children in high-\\nburden countries through regular screening \\nand infection hotspot maps. It supports the \\nWorld Health Organization’s mission to \\neliminate mother-to-child transmission of \\nHIV, HBV and syphilis by\\xa02030.\\n Malnutrition Panel: research is underway to \\nimprove well-being for children and pregnant \\nwomen, using biomarkers to identify \\nmicronutrient deficiencies via clinical and  \\nat-home tests. Development of this panel  \\nwill continue into 2022 and beyond.\\n\\n• • \\n\\n• •  Fever Panel: development has started to \\n\\nunderstand how biomarkers can help clinicians \\nbetter identify root causes of fever, enabling \\nproper treatment and care. This will be \\nparticularly important in pregnant women \\nand young children. It will also aid infection \\nidentification in patients with fever-like and \\nother “generic” symptoms.\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nDRIVING DIABETES CARE IN \\nUNDERINVESTED COMMUNITIES \\nIn 2019, the Abbott Fund launched our  \\nFuture Well Communities program in Stockton, \\nCalifornia, to address health disparities by \\nremoving barriers that prevent people with \\ndiabetes from living a healthy life.

This includes \\nincreasing NCD screening, providing health \\neducation, monitoring and referral services, \\nand building capacity and awareness on \\nprevention and control. Abbott has also been \\ndonating rapid-testing technology, diabetes \\nmonitors and test strips.\\n\\nThe results are encouraging. Following \\ntargeted interventions, patients with \\ncontrolled blood sugar levels rose to 59.1%, up \\nfrom 50.8% at baseline, and more than 65% of \\npatients improved their fasting glucose level, \\nwhich is important to reducing overall risks of \\nrelated health complications.\\n\\nNATURAL DISASTER RELIEF \\nFor 16 years, we have been partnering with \\nFeeding America and Direct Relief to prepare \\ncommunities for hurricane season. Critically \\nneeded supplies, including rehydration \\nsolutions and nutrition products, are \\ndistributed to food banks and health clinics \\nacross high-risk areas in the U.S. and Puerto \\nRico. In 2021, these programs supported more \\nthan 12,000 people. Last year, we broadened \\nthese efforts, implementing a disaster \\nresilience strategy to help prevent and mitigate \\nnegative impacts on communities in New \\nOrleans, Dallas, Orlando and Puerto Rico. \\n\\nWe are committed to rapid response following \\nnatural disasters and other emergencies. In \\n2021, Abbott and the Abbott Fund donated \\napproximately $2 million in cash and product \\nto address immediate needs and long-term \\nrecovery efforts. This included providing relief \\nfollowing flooding in China, Germany, Turkey \\nand the U.S.; earthquakes in Croatia and Haiti; \\nwildfires in Turkey; hurricanes in the U.S.; and \\nsupport for Afghan refugees in the U.S.\\n\\nWhen communities thrive, we all thrive. \\nAbbott has a long-standing history of \\ncontributing expertise, product, cash and \\ntime to help support our communities. \\n\\nTACKLING NON-\\nCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES\\nOur Future Well initiatives help drive progress \\nagainst noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).

Our focus is to create a \\nstrong cybersecurity foundation by placing \\ncontrols around our infrastructure and securing \\nour operations to reduce vulnerabilities. We \\ndo this through education and awareness, \\ndesigning the right cybersecurity architecture, \\nimplementing incident monitoring and response \\nefforts, manufacturing cybersecurity, disaster \\nrecovery planning efforts and other services \\nprovided to the enterprise. Regardless of where \\nemployees are or what business function they \\nrepresent, Abbott believes every employee \\nplays a critical role in protecting Abbott data \\n\\nand business systems and infrastructure. Our \\ncompany-wide cybersecurity training program \\nensures that employees and contractors receive \\ntargeted training on phishing awareness \\nand monitors results to identify retraining \\nrequirements. This way, we can help ensure \\neveryone at Abbott understands that protecting \\nsensitive data and personal information is \\neveryone’s responsibility.\\n\\nThis year we created new roles for divisional \\nBusiness Information Security Officers \\n(BISOs) to embed cybersecurity further into \\nour businesses. Additionally, the Data Loss \\nProtection Program is designed to implement \\nthe proper security controls that will help \\nmonitor and prevent unauthorized data sharing.\\n\\nPARTNERING ON SECURITY\\nCybersecurity issues can’t be addressed \\nin a vacuum. That’s why we maintain \\nmulti-stakeholder partnerships to \\nunderstand the latest cybersecurity \\nthreats and trends, support research \\nand inform new standards and best \\npractices,\\xa0including: \\n• •  Health Information Sharing and \\n\\nAnalysis Center (H-ISAC)\\n• •  Medical Device Innovation \\n\\n• • \\n\\nConsortium (MDIC)\\nInternational Medical Device \\nRegulators Forum (IMDRF)\\n• •  Healthcare and Public Health \\nSector Coordinating Council \\n(HPHSCC)\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nWe maintain a cybersecurity certification \\nprogram that includes SOC 2 and ISO 27001 \\nassessments for multiple Abbott products that \\nprocess protected health information. These \\nassessments are performed by an independent \\nexternal auditor and cover the design and \\neffectiveness of Abbott’s cybersecurity program \\nand controls. \\n\\nMany of our products and programs are \\ndesigned to collect information that can help \\npeople make better decisions about managing \\ntheir health. This information also helps us \\nunderstand how to make our products better \\nand what our customers want to learn more \\nabout. Our goal is to ensure our devices, \\nproducts and systems meet the highest security \\nstandards, and that commitment guides our \\napproach to protecting data and privacy across \\nour businesses.\\n\\nTo strengthen our ability to respond to changing \\ncircumstances, we have developed a customized \\ncybersecurity control framework, informed by \\nrobust existing internal and industry strategies. \\nThe framework will support Product Security \\nmaturity assessments, providing a benchmark \\nagainst which to measure progress. \\n\\nProduct Cybersecurity \\nThe growth of connected medical devices, \\nproducts, diagnostics platforms and systems \\nmeans healthcare professionals can provide \\ntheir patients with smarter, faster and more \\neffective treatments. At Abbott, we are \\nunlocking potential solutions to some of our \\nmost difficult healthcare challenges.

We engage \\nwith candidates to provide all the information \\nthey need to succeed during interviews — \\nincluding offering them access to our Abbott \\nTalent Community — and maintain ongoing \\nconnections with them through our social \\nchannels. This way, we can build a pipeline of \\nqualified, interested candidates that we can \\nconsider for future opportunities. \\n\\n5 In previous years, we reported on our corporate-sponsored training \\nonly. Due to enhancement in data collection, we are including trainings \\nconducted by our businesses in this submission; these programs were \\nnot previously reported. Hence, our results are significantly higher \\nthan in 2020. \\n\\nIn addition, we engage organizations such as \\nAdvancing Minorities’ Interest in Engineering \\n(AMIE) and the Society of Women Engineers \\nto identify diverse talent. Partnerships with \\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities \\n(HBCUs) institutions like Howard University \\nand North Carolina Agricultural and Technical \\nState University also support our future \\nemployee pipeline. \\n\\nOur career site employs artificial intelligence \\nto enhance the application process, \\nstreamlining user experiences with tailored \\ncontent and a personalized chatbot to help \\nidentify roles. In 2021, Abbott filled 26,184 \\npositions, and 15% of all open positions were \\nfilled by internal candidates. \\n\\nDeveloping Employees\\nIn addition to attracting new employees, we \\nare committed to developing and retaining our \\ncurrent employees. Through our many programs \\nand resources, we provide opportunities for \\nindividual growth and development, helping \\nemployees build great long-term careers at \\nAbbott. We value our experienced employees; \\ntheir knowledge helps us succeed as a company \\nand contributes to a strong succession pipeline. \\nSome of the resources that help our employees \\nprogress include: \\n\\n• •  Ongoing reviews, career development \\n\\ndiscussions and goal setting with managers \\n\\n• •  Access to Career Connect — our personalized \\n\\ncareer development and planning tool\\n\\n• •  Mentoring, job-specific education  \\n\\nand leadership training \\n\\n• •  Annual performance management processes \\n\\nOur Board of Directors conducts an annual \\nTalent Management Review (TMR) to \\nreview critical position succession plans and \\ndevelopment actions. TMRs are also held at \\ndivisional, functional, country, region and \\nteam levels to find Ready Now and Ready \\nFuture successors, and to support intentional \\ndevelopment plans for them. Included in these \\ndiscussions is the identification of early career \\ntalent with leadership potential. \\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nLearning Opportunities \\nWe offer many employee development \\nopportunities, working to bring more online \\neach year. Throughout 2021, we delivered \\nan average of 28 hours of training and \\ndevelopment per full-time employee (FTE).5 \\nThis equated to an average training and \\ndevelopment spend of $227 per FTE. \\n\\nAlso in 2021, Abbott launched a comprehensive \\nleadership training program called Leading \\nWith Impact (LWI) for over 18,000 people \\nmanagers worldwide. LWI provides 12 weeks \\nof self-paced, virtually delivered, immediately \\napplicable coaching and training.\\n\\nBy the end of 2021, 17,375 people managers \\nhad participated. Through the program, they \\ngained new skills, tools and perspectives to \\nhelp them create a more supportive, inclusive \\nand rewarding environment for their teams.\\n\\nIndustry-Leading Internships \\nInternships offer future innovators first-\\nhand industry experience. Throughout 2021, \\nwe expanded our IT and Computer Science \\ninternship in the U.S., with plans underway to \\nbring our Engineering co-op program to more \\napplicants.

We want \\nit to be the natural way things get done at \\nAbbott. It takes all of us to build and maintain \\nthe just and inclusive culture we want to live \\nand work in. To help build engagement, we’ve \\ninitiated a program of “Let’s Talk” sessions, in \\nwhich employees engage in open and honest \\ndiscussions about diversity and inclusion.\\n\\nWe are increasing representation of \\nunderrepresented groups throughout \\nAbbott. Our Executive Diversity Council \\nconsists of diverse leaders who demonstrate \\ntheir commitment to diversity and \\ninclusion. Members are selected based on \\ncharacteristics and qualities that highlight \\ntheir desire to champion and drive diversity \\nand inclusion and span across the enterprise.\\n\\nThe council meets several times a year to \\ndiscuss key successes related to diversity and \\ninclusion in the current year, and establish \\nclear priorities for the future. The council \\ncan serve as an ad hoc advisor on new \\nprograms proposed to maximize inclusion \\nat Abbott, and holds a formal responsibility \\nfor supporting the diversity and inclusion \\nstrategy development, ensuring diversity \\nand inclusion practices are integrated into \\nbusiness practices/strategy, and program \\nimplementation at Abbott.\\n\\nCommunities of Support \\nEmployee networks bring underrepresented \\nemployees (and their allies) together to share \\nexperiences, expand visibility and create \\nopportunities.

By supporting \\nlocal causes, our employees bring to life \\nAbbott’s purpose to help more people \\nthan ever achieve better health. \\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nCaring has always been one of our core values. \\nOur Employee Giving Program and volunteering \\noptions create spaces for employees to uphold \\nthis legacy of care in their communities. \\nOversight for community engagement sits \\nwith our Citizenship organization, including \\nemployee giving and volunteering, as well as \\nprograms and strategies for product donations. \\n\\nEmployee Donations and Matched Giving \\nIn 2021, we introduced our enhanced \\nEmployee Giving Program in the U.S. and \\nPuerto Rico. The program brings together \\nour existing Employee Giving Campaign and \\n\\nAbbott Fund Matching Grant Program into  \\none integrated donation program. \\n\\nThrough the new Employee Giving Program, the \\nAbbott Fund has expanded its guidelines, making \\nmore nonprofit organizations eligible for matched \\ndonations, and doubling its match to 100% of \\neligible donations, up from 50% previously. And, \\nso every cent goes to the charity of choice, Abbott \\ncommits to paying all processing fees. \\n\\nEmployee Volunteering \\nWe provide employees with a range of \\nopportunities for local volunteering.

We are committed to equal pay for \\nequal work, and do not tolerate discrimination \\nin pay, as stated in our position statement \\non human rights. Three concepts guide \\ndevelopment of consistent, fair compensation: \\n\\n• •  Base salaries and benefits are based on, \\n\\nand competitive in, the markets where we \\ncompete for talent\\n\\n• •  Annual and long-term incentives are linked \\n\\nto business and individual performance, \\nwith a balance of short- and long-term \\nfinancial and strategic objectives \\n\\n• •  Compensation encourages behavior \\nconsistent with the ethical values in \\nAbbott’s Code of Business Conduct \\n\\nOur leadership covenant specifically states \\nthat senior leaders are accountable for the \\nachievement of Abbott’s 2030 Sustainability \\nPlan goals. Any corporate officer that does not \\nfulfill the covenant can receive a reduction of \\nup to 100% of their annual incentive and/or \\nlong-term incentive awards.\\n\\nA Stake in Abbott7 \\nHelping employees build an ownership stake \\nin Abbott is key to our philosophy. Several \\nprograms facilitate this: \\n\\n• •  Global long-term incentive program: \\ngrants restricted stock units (RSUs) to \\nemployees, generally beginning at the \\nmanager level. Paid out in shares of Abbott \\ncommon stock (except in countries that \\nrequire cash payment). \\n\\n• •  401(k) program: offers employees in \\n\\nthe U.S. and Puerto Rico a 5% match for \\nemployee contributions of 2% or more. \\nEmployees can choose from a range of \\ninvestments, including company stock. \\n\\n• •  Employees Stock Purchase Plan: offers \\nemployees (excluding corporate officers) \\nin most countries outside the U.S. stock at a \\ndiscounted price.\\n\\n7 Eligibility for nonsalary benefits follows local regulations and practices. In most countries, this means we offer benefits to full-time employees \\nand part-time employees working more than a certain number of hours. Outside the U.S., we typically provide benefit programs above and beyond \\ngovernment requirements.\\n8 Full-time, permanent employees with loans under the Dutch student loan system implemented in 2015.\\n\\nEnabling Financial Freedom\\nOur first-of-its-kind Freedom 2 Save program \\nhelps U.S. employees save for retirement while \\nrepaying student loans. Employees who put \\nat least 2% of eligible pay toward repayments \\nreceive a 5% 401(k) contribution from Abbott. \\nMore than 1,400 employees have enrolled, \\nwith Abbott contributing over $3.5 million \\ndollars to their accounts. \\n\\nFor retirement-eligible employees, Freedom to \\nWork supports reduced schedules, workloads \\nand/or responsibilities while allowing employees \\nto continue building retirement income. Over \\n1,800 employees have enrolled since 2008.\\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nIn 2021, Abbott granted RSUs to 13,199 \\nemployees across 71 countries, while more than \\n18,000 employees in 60 countries participated \\nin our Employees Stock Purchase Plan. \\n\\nSupporting Financial Independence \\nA new college loan repayment program in the \\nNetherlands is helping more employees achieve \\nfinancial independence. Eligible employees8 \\ncan receive reimbursement from Abbott of \\n¤1,200 annually, up to a total of 50% of post-\\ngraduation balance. \\n\\nEnabling Further Education with FreeU\\nWe know financial considerations can \\nrepresent a barrier to further education. \\nIn 2021, we launched FreeU that, when \\ncombined with our tuition reimbursement \\nprogram, enables employees to pursue a \\nbachelor’s degree at no personal cost. This \\nprogram underscores Abbott’s commitment \\nto\\xa0— and belief in\\xa0— developing our people \\nso they can pursue rewarding careers.\\nAbbott pays the full cost of required starting \\ncoursework.

We offer \\nprograms that support work–life harmony \\nand promote good health, with many \\navailable to employees’ families as well.\\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nWe recognize that, to feel and perform \\nat their best, employees must be able to \\nbalance work and family responsibilities. \\nDuring the pandemic, we recognized that \\nthe way we work was going to change. So, \\nbuilding upon our long-standing practice of \\nflexibility, we made changes to support these \\ntrends, offering eligible employees enhanced \\nopportunities to benefit from options like \\nflextime, compressed work weeks, reduced \\nschedules, job sharing and remote working. \\nWe also made changes to our U.S. vacation \\npolicy to offer employees more weeks of paid \\ntime off earlier in their careers.\\n\\nIn the U.S., on-site child care, discounts \\non external child care, and parenting and \\ncounseling services are provided. New \\nparents are offered eight weeks’ paid leave, \\nand since 2015, we have given financial \\nsupport for adoption of up to $20,000 \\nper child. \\n\\nOur company-funded Employee Assistance \\nProgram (EAP) provides free expert mental \\nhealth support for employees and their \\nfamilies through one-on-one assistance, \\nseminars, online courses, crisis intervention \\nservices and workplace emergency response. \\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nSupporting Every Employee\\nWe want as many of our people as possible \\nto benefit from well-being services. In 2021, \\nwe expanded our EAP to the Czech Republic, \\nSlovakia, South Africa and Vietnam, reaching \\nmore employees with mental health support. \\nThis builds on the more than 20 countries we \\nintroduced the EAP to in 2020 and brings  \\nthe total program presence to more than  \\n50 countries.\\n\\nThousands of employees participated in \\nwellness sessions, including a webinar \\non reducing stress, overcoming burnout, \\nenhancing relationships and creating work–\\nlife balance, and a live meditation session. In \\nhonor of World Mental Health Day in October, \\nwe offered employees across the world three \\nmental health awareness webinars.\\n\\nIn India, the second wave of COVID-19 \\npresented a difficult situation with the average \\ndaily case numbers peaking above 300,000. \\nThis led to a scarcity of oxygen, medicines, \\nhospital beds, ventilators and access to \\ndoctors and a medical infrastructure stretched \\nbeyond capacity. Our team in India mobilized \\nresources to build a regional task force and \\na comprehensive program for employees \\nand their families. They delivered support \\nto employees that included telemedicine \\nand home COVID-19 management; robust \\nemployee communications and support; \\noxygen concentrators for employee usage and \\nvaccinations for all employees.\\n\\nA Globally Recognized Commitment to Our Employees\\nWe prioritize well-being because we care about our employees. \\nWhile\\xa0not motivated by external recognition, we are proud \\nto have been featured in several global indices for our efforts \\nthroughout\\xa02021. \\n• •  Great Place to Work certified  \\n(U.S., U.K., Brazil, Costa Rica)\\n Fortune Best Workplaces in Health Care and Best Big \\nCompanies to Work For\\n\\n• • \\n\\n• •  Seramount 100 Best Company\\n• •  Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption Best Adoption-\\n\\nFriendly\\xa0Workplace\\n\\n• •  Science magazine Top Employer\\n• •  Certified Top Employer by Top Employers Institute  \\n\\nin six EU\\xa0and\\xa0three Middle East countries\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nEmployee Health and Safety\\n\\nThe health and safety of our employees and \\ncontract workers is paramount for Abbott. \\nThrough an integrated Environment, \\nHealth and Safety (EHS) management \\nsystem and a dedicated EHS Leadership \\nCouncil, we are embedding a culture of \\nsafety across every area of our business.\\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nOur EHS Leadership Council governs the \\nEHS organization. It comprises professionals \\nwho manage internal programs across \\n90 manufacturing sites, and commercial \\nprofessionals who support field-based \\nteams, offices and warehouses in more \\nthan 90 countries. The commercial EHS \\norganization is divided across six regions, \\neach with a dedicated manager. At each \\nAbbott site, designated safety representatives \\nand safety teams help ensure the successful \\nimplementation of our internal programs.\\n\\nWe maintain global policies and standards  \\nfor managing employee health and safety. \\nExperts regularly update these to reflect \\nchanges in regulations and global expectations. \\nSimilar standards extend to contractors \\n\\nworking at Abbott locations. Each site \\nmust comply with robust contractor EHS \\nmanagement programs, including: \\n\\n• •  Training for Abbott employees responsible \\n\\nfor contractor activities\\n\\n• •  An EHS approval process for \\n\\ncontractor companies \\n\\n• •  Orientations for contractor employees\\n\\n• •  EHS plans for projects over $2 million\\n\\n• •  A full-time safety representative on large \\n\\nconstruction projects \\n\\n• •  Inspections of contractor activity\\n\\n• •  Contractor completion of Job Hazard \\n\\nAnalyses or Risk Assessment and \\nMethod Statements \\n\\n• •  Evaluation of contractor company’s \\n\\nEHS performance \\n\\nWe regularly evaluate commercial operations, \\nmanufacturing and research and development \\n(R&D) sites through internal compliance \\nassurance audits that cover: \\n\\n• •  Health and safety \\n\\n• •  Strategic planning and prioritization \\n\\n• •  Risk assessment/self-assessment \\n\\n• •  Business integration \\n\\n• •  Training and awareness \\n\\n• •  Communication and information \\n\\n• •  Performance measures \\n\\nSenior leadership uses EHS scorecards to \\nmonitor performance. We communicate results \\nacross our organization, identifying necessary \\ncorrective actions and ensuring actions are \\ncompleted on time. A separate Global Health \\nScorecard is used by site and divisional leaders \\nto track implementation of occupational health \\nand well-being initiatives. Each site is required \\nto improve its score annually. \\n\\nOccupational Health Services \\nOur global Occupational Health Services \\n(OHS) team — part of the EHS organization — \\ndevelops and maintains occupational health \\n(OH) policies, procedures and guidelines, trains \\nrelevant employees and consults on regulatory \\ncompliance. Together with the EHS team, they \\nlead our response to public health emergencies \\nwith the potential to impact our business, such \\nas the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nThis team is also responsible for implementing \\nour global employee health and productivity \\nstrategy, tracking progress against key \\nperformance indicators (KPIs) and identifying \\nimprovement opportunities. To support this, \\nwe have developed our Occupational Health \\nServices Standard, requiring facilities to \\nprovide adequate resources and designated \\nhealthcare professionals with site-specific \\nknowledge. Today, over 130 OH professionals \\nsupport employee health and well-being, treat \\nillnesses and injuries, and maintain employee \\nmedical records. They conduct regular \\nscreenings and health education programs to \\nidentify and minimize occupational risks. \\n\\nOur Reproductive Hazard Management \\nStandard ensures the health and safety of \\nemployees and their potential future children. \\nWe also use established external standards \\nand certifications to drive continuous \\nimprovement. At the end of 2021, 22 \\nAbbott sites were certified to International \\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) 45001.\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nFostering a Health and Safety Culture \\nTo build a robust health and safety culture, we \\nmust engage everyone at Abbott — something \\nwe achieve and maintain through our EHS \\npolicy and several technical and management \\nstandards, including: \\n\\n• •  Risk Assessment and Self-Assessment \\nManagement Standard: requirements  \\nfor assessing and mitigating health and \\nsafety risks \\n\\n• •  Training and Awareness Management \\nStandard: requirements for employees to \\nbe aware of health and safety risks and have \\nknowledge of job-specific hazards\\n\\n• •  Area-specific technical standards:  \\n\\ne.g., Fleet Safety, Control of Hazardous \\nEnergy, Confined Spaces, Ergonomics, \\nElectrical Safety, Biological Safety and \\nWorking at Heights \\n\\n• •  Emergency Preparedness Standard: \\n\\nrequirements for emergency preparedness \\nplanning and minimum requirements to \\nensure health and safety on-site and in \\nsurrounding communities.

However, each division also \\nimplemented initiatives to drive improvement. \\nThese include ongoing driver safety initiatives \\nand multiple ergonomic projects. Our 2021 lost-\\ntime case rate has remained consistent with what \\nwe achieved in 2020, even as operational activity \\nand on-site working returned to pre-pandemic \\nlevels at certain facilities. We are also happy \\nto report that Abbott experienced no fatalities \\namong our employees or contractors in 2021.\\n\\nIncreasingly Robust Standards\\nOur teams have worked to increase \\nunderstanding of workplace health and safety \\nissues, updating our protocols to safeguard \\nagainst occupational injuries and illness. We \\nrefreshed our internal ergonomic technical \\nstandard to more thoroughly address \\nthe leading causes of illness and injuries. \\nAdditionally, increased focus was placed on \\ncreating a global task force on lockout/tagout \\ncontrol of hazardous energy, a step that will \\nhelp ensure enhanced safety procedures are \\nfollowed when servicing machinery. \\n\\nA Global Safe-Driving Program\\nOur safe-driving program reduces vehicle \\naccidents across Abbott. In Latin America, \\na new driver risk assessment covers driver \\nprofile, driving behaviors and knowledge of \\nlocal traffic regulations. This information will \\nhelp us develop trainings targeted to drivers’ \\nspecific risk level. In India, our commercial \\nEHS team is developing a vehicle safety \\ninitiative focused on two-wheelers to reduce \\ncrash-related injuries.\\n\\nContinuing to Keep People Healthy  \\nDuring COVID-19\\nThroughout 2021, we have maintained robust \\non-site cleaning procedures and continued to \\nprovide personal protective equipment (PPE) \\n\\nto those who require it. To keep employees \\nhealthy we offered on-site testing and vaccine \\nclinics in certain locations. \\n\\nIn the U.S., we regularly test employees and \\ncontractors directly involved in manufacturing \\nour COVID-19 tests, and have expanded this \\ntesting to other facilities and offices across \\nthe U.S. and at our facilities in other countries \\nas well. This ambitious employee testing \\nprogram has resulted in more than 3 million \\ntests performed globally since the start of the \\nemployee and contractor testing. We have also \\ndeveloped guidelines on traveling, returning \\nto work and case management to reduce \\ntransmission risks.\\n\\nWhile social distancing, wearing a mask, \\nfrequent hand washing, and asking that \\nemployees stay home (with pay) if they feel \\nill or show symptoms are all critical steps to \\nmaintaining a healthy work environment, our \\nprogram of regular testing gave our employees \\nadditional peace of mind as they returned to \\nthe office. Measures have been introduced on a \\nsite-by-site basis, timed to align with country-\\nspecific regulatory developments. \\n\\nOHS Performance\\nAbbott senior leadership regularly reviews \\nOHS data to help ensure continuous \\nimprovement in this area.\\n\\n \\n\\nLost-Time Case Rate9  \\nEmployee and Contractor\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nVehicle Accidents per Million Miles  \\nEmployees\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nRecordable Case Rate10  \\nEmployees\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n0.12\\n0.13\\n0.30\\n0.24\\n\\n2.61\\n2.7\\n3.9\\n4.1\\n\\n0.29\\n0.28\\n0.46\\n0.41\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nPROTECT A  \\nHEALTHY  \\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nWe are champions for health.

Our \\nEHS organization reports to the Senior Vice \\nPresident, Quality Assurance, Regulatory and \\nEngineering Services who, in turn, reports to \\nour Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Senior \\nVice President is also the executive sponsor \\nfor the development of our climate and \\nwater strategy. \\n\\nPolicies and Management Systems \\nOur policies and standards are updated regularly \\nto reflect best practices, regulatory trends and \\nrequirements. A comprehensive audit program \\nmonitors compliance and identifies potential \\nrisks to our business and employees. \\n\\nWe evaluate EHS risk factors for each site \\nannually, using insights to determine audit \\nfrequency. Following audits, corrective \\naction plans are developed, implemented and \\nmonitored where needed. \\n\\nEnvironmental and Ecosystem Protection\\nProtecting biodiversity and ecosystems is \\nkey to environmental management. Abbott \\nmaintains technical standards for preventing \\nunpermitted environmental releases that \\nfacilities must comply with alongside \\nrelevant external regulations. Many sites have \\nimplemented protective measures, including \\nprocesses to safeguard soil and groundwater, \\nprotect and restore wetlands and prairies, and \\nremove invasive species.\\n\\nMergers and Acquisitions\\nOur EHS policy requires that EHS liability and \\ncompliance evaluations are conducted prior \\nto all property and business acquisitions and \\ndivestitures. Compliance with our EHS policy \\nis also incorporated into all new acquisitions. \\nThe type of due diligence we undertake \\ndepends on the nature of the transaction:\\n\\n• •  Real property transactions: \\n\\nEnvironmental due diligence is conducted \\nto evaluate potential environmental risks \\nand liabilities associated with real property \\nacquisitions and divestitures. \\n\\n• •  Business acquisitions: In conjunction \\n\\nwith environmental due diligence, a \\ncompany’s EHS resources and programs \\nare assessed, gaps identified and resources \\nestimated to align with regulatory \\nrequirements and Abbott standards.\\n\\nAbbott develops multi-year integration plans \\nto ensure acquisitions align with our EHS \\nmanagement practices and standards. This \\nincludes providing training and resources to \\nenable implementation of our EHS policy. \\nProgress against integration plans is monitored \\nto help ensure their ongoing efficacy. The final \\nstep in integration plans is often an internal \\nEHS compliance audit to ensure acquired \\nbusinesses are fully aligned. \\n\\nEngaging Employees in Our Efforts \\nAll EHS employees receive training on \\nour standards and changing regulatory \\nrequirements. We maintain several employee \\nengagement initiatives, including: \\n\\n• •  Evaluating EHS leaders against \\n\\nperformance goals in annual reviews\\n\\n• •  Raising awareness of priority EHS issues \\n\\nthrough dedicated discussion forums\\n\\n• •  Recognizing exceptional performance \\n\\nthrough our annual EHS Awards Program \\n\\nAll EHS policies and standards are available \\nonline.

One way \\nwe do this is by reducing our emissions, \\nfinding more efficient ways to use energy \\nand limiting reliance on fossil fuels. \\n\\nOUR IMPACT\\nWe realize our emissions contribute to global \\nclimate change. Our operational activities \\nproduce Scope 1 (direct) and 2 (indirect)11 \\nemissions. Emissions from activities like business \\ntravel, waste disposal, raw material sourcing and \\nprocessing, and product distribution, packaging \\nand disposal — collectively known as Scope 3 \\nemissions — also contribute to our footprint. \\n\\nWe’re working to reduce the negative impacts \\nof our emissions by investing in renewable \\nenergy, reducing fleet fuel consumption, \\nincreasing manufacturing efficiency and \\npartnering with suppliers. \\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nWe maintain a robust program for recording \\nand reducing energy and air emissions, \\noutlined in both our Climate Responsible \\nEnergy Policy and Internal Energy Guidelines. \\nAlong with these documents, our Global EHS \\nGovernance team provides guidance on:\\n\\n• •  Energy efficiency in  \\n\\nmanufacturing operations\\n\\n• •  Low-carbon energy investments \\n\\n• •  Transportation fleet efficiency\\n\\n• •  Supply chain carbon footprint \\n\\n• •  Public reporting of our performance \\n\\nWe align with international frameworks — \\nincluding CDP and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) \\nProtocol — to measure, track, reduce and  \\nreport emissions.\\n\\n11 Scope 1 emissions result from owned and controlled sources.

By \\n2030, we plan to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions \\nby 30%12 (vs. 2018). \\n\\nWe have established a comprehensive program \\nfor reducing these emissions, including measures \\nto advance: \\n\\n• •  Operational energy efficiency, driving \\n\\nreductions in energy demands\\n\\n• •  Purchase of renewable energy \\n\\n• •  Electrification of industrial processes, \\n\\nspaces and fleets\\n\\n• •  Conversion to cleaner fuel options\\n\\n• •  Integration of sustainable engineering \\ntechnologies and concepts into projects\\n\\nEach Abbott business sets individual annual \\nenergy efficiency targets. Manufacturing sites \\nthat produce over 25,000 metric tons of CO2e \\nannually are required to set additional carbon \\nreduction goals. \\n\\nOur Scope 3 emissions constitute around 93% \\nof total emissions. We calculate them annually \\nusing the GHG Protocol Corporate Value \\nChain (Scope 3) Standard, referring to the 10 \\nScope 3 categories* that apply to Abbott (see \\nOur Carbon Footprint infographic). \\n\\nWe’re currently developing a quantitative \\ntarget for Scope 3 emissions. This will include \\nworking with key carbon-intensive suppliers \\non emission reduction solutions. Read more \\nabout supply chain efforts on page 62. \\n\\nWe have our data assured every year. All \\nScope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as Scope \\n3 emissions related to business travel and \\noperational waste production, are verified \\nthrough a third-party assurance process. Our \\nlatest assurance statement is available on our \\nEnvironmental Policy page. \\n\\nRegulated Air Emissions \\nThe production of some Abbott products \\ninvolves substances that are ozone-depleting \\nor classified as hazardous or toxic air \\npollutants (HAPs) by local environmental \\nprotection agencies.

When adjusted for sales, \\nScope 1 and 2 emissions decreased 17% \\nover this same time period. In 2021, as our \\nproducts  — including COVID-19 testing and \\ndiagnostics — became increasingly important \\nfor patients and healthcare workers globally, \\nwe expanded production, which has come \\nwith a rise in emissions. As we move forward, \\nwe continue to identify ways to reduce our \\ncarbon footprint year-on-year to achieve our \\n2030 goal. \\n\\nA More Energy-Efficient Global Operation\\nTo reduce energy demand, we have made \\nseveral operational energy-efficient \\nimprovements as retrofits to existing \\nequipment or through active and efficient \\nin-house energy management. Several sites \\nuse energy data and innovative methods to \\nidentify and quantify energy inefficiencies in \\nmanufacturing processes, often employing \\nexternal experts. These insights then inform \\na list of priority energy demand reduction \\nprojects across the global business. \\n\\nFor example, in Indonesia, many of our motors \\nhave been upgraded with variable speed \\ndrives, reducing energy requirements while \\nretaining performance. \\n\\nOur manufacturing site in Singapore achieved \\nan 8% CO2 emissions intensity reduction in \\n2021 even with an 11% increase in volume, \\nthrough initiatives pioneered by our Utilities \\nExcellence team. More than 200 metric tons \\nCO2e annual reduction were realized by \\ninstalling a boiler oxygen management system \\nin our three steam boilers. This increased \\nboiler efficiency by 3%, by controlling excess \\noxygen and fuel ratio to increase percentage \\nof complete combustion. Another project to \\nupgrade cooling-tower fins, louvres and  \\nin-fills resulted in an annual reduction of about \\n250 metric tons CO2e.\\n\\nTo reduce safety and supply chain risk, one \\nof our facilities in Peru switched from using \\nliquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to feed the \\nboilers, kitchen and laboratory workstations \\nto instead supply with natural gas. This switch \\nalso resulted in a financial saving, plus an \\nenvironmental benefit of an annual GHG \\nemission reduction of about 20 metric tons. \\n\\nPowering Our Facilities Renewably \\nWe are committed to purchasing a greater \\nproportion of electricity from renewable \\nsources and are developing a Renewable \\nEnergy Procurement initiative to drive \\ncontinuous improvement in this area. In 2021, \\nwe purchased 190 million kWh of low-carbon \\nand renewable energy, resulting in savings of \\n80,000 metric tons of CO2e. In addition, we \\nalso generated 1.8 million kWh from solar \\ninstallations at eight of our sites. \\n\\nIncreasingly Green Transport \\nWe have established a range of initiatives to \\nmanage fuel consumption in our commercial \\nfleet as well as the fuel consumption during \\nemployee commuting. These include \\nestablishing increasingly robust requirements \\nfor vehicle fuel efficiency, providing on-site \\nelectric vehicle charging stations, promoting \\ncar-sharing and, where possible, public \\ntransportation use.\\n\\nBringing Greater Clarity to \\nScope\\xa03\\xa0Emissions \\nTo expand understanding of Scope 3 emissions, \\nwe partnered with an external consultant to \\nupdate our calculation methodology.

In response, work is now \\nunderway to replace the probes with alternatives \\nthat can withstand higher temperatures of \\nsteam condensate, eliminating the need for \\ncooling water. \\nThe first phase of the project will save the site \\napproximately 3.2 million gallons of soft water \\nand 106,000 gallons of make-up water. We \\nreceived capital project funds to complete \\na second phase, adding six additional high-\\ntemperature probes to our system. These new \\nprobes will allow continuous monitoring of our \\nsix largest condensate return legs, saving an \\nestimated additional 200,000 gallons of  \\nmake-up water per year with annual savings  \\nof $2,800.\\nOverall, the improvements will save the site \\napproximately 3.5 million gallons of water per \\nyear, a 2% reduction in water intake. The overall \\neconomic impact of both phases of the project \\ntotals $27,000 in annual savings.\\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE\\nFoundational elements have been set to \\nsupport future water stewardship certification \\nand management practices. \\n\\nWater Stewardship Certification \\nWe aim to achieve water stewardship \\ncertification at all high water impact \\nmanufacturing sites in water-stressed regions. \\nIn 2021, 25 of our manufacturing sites were \\nidentified as operating in areas of water stress. \\nOf those, 48% used less than 15 million gallons \\nof water while nine sites were deemed high \\nimpact considering basin water stress, basin \\nwater depletion level and water usage. Aligned \\nwith our context-based approach and based \\non the potential for these sites to significantly \\nimpact local communities, we have targeted \\nthem for AWS water stewardship certification. \\nAlignment with the standard is intended to \\nachieve five main outcomes: \\n\\n• •  Good water governance\\n\\n• •  Sustainable water balance\\n\\n• •  Good water quality status \\n\\n• •  Important water-related areas \\n\\n• •  Safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)\\n\\nWe have established a Community of \\nPractice for our nine High Water Impact \\nSites to support progress toward AWS water \\nstewardship certification. Strategic roadmaps \\nhighlight key steps for achieving certification.\\n\\nWater Stewardship Management Practices \\nWe will implement accredited water \\nstewardship management practices in more \\nthan 75% of all manufacturing sites operating in \\nwater-stressed regions by 2030. In 2021, we set \\nthis in motion for 16 sites identified as being in \\nwater-stressed areas not classified as being high \\nwater impact. While these sites have less impact \\nthan our high water impact facilities, it is also \\nimportant for them to adopt water stewardship \\npractices that support achievement of the \\noutcomes described above. \\n\\nDraft accredited water stewardship practices \\nare currently under expert review. They will \\nbe finalized in 2022 alongside a supporting \\nguidance document. The new Community of \\nPractice will help sites stay on track through \\nquarterly reporting and act as a resource for \\nshared learning between facilities.\\n\\nWater-Saving Solutions\\nTotal water intake in 2021 rose by \\napproximately 4% versus the previous year — \\na result of increased production in 2021. When \\nadjusted for sales, water intake decreased 16% \\ncompared to 2020. Nonetheless, we continually \\nlook for ways to reduce absolute withdrawals — \\nwith a particular focus on those facilities in \\nwater-stressed areas. In Minnesota, low-flow \\nfaucets and fixtures have been installed, saving \\nthe site 73,000 gallons in a single year. In Costa \\nRica, we are reducing reliance on groundwater \\nby harvesting rainwater and reusing water \\n\\nfrom our cooling towers in the site toilets and \\nirrigation system.\\n\\nOur efforts in Spain — where we operate \\nin a water-stressed area — are even more \\nsubstantial. We have achieved significant \\nreductions in both water use and wastewater \\nproduction by installing a second RO water \\npurification system. By increasing capacity to \\nrecover and treat 70% of water rejected by the \\nfirst RO system, across 2020 and 2021 we saved \\nover 8 million gallons of water. Additionally, by \\nreducing well water consumption by 11%, the \\nsite has also achieved notable energy savings \\nof 12,800 kWh every year — and avoided \\napproximately 3.7 metric tons of CO2e.\\n\\nRead more about our emission reductions on \\npage 43. \\n\\nIdentifying Supply Chain Focus Points \\nIn addition to addressing direct water impacts, \\nby 2030 we aim to work with 50 key suppliers \\nin high water-stressed areas to reduce quality \\nand quantity risks in our supply chain.

When adjusted for \\nsales, waste production decreased 8.6% versus \\n2020. We continue to identify opportunities to \\ndivert materials from landfill, and advance the \\nZero Waste-to-Landfill initiative we launched \\nin 2012. In 2021, seven manufacturing facilities \\nand one non-manufacturing facility received \\nZero Waste-to-Landfill certification, bringing \\nour total number of facilities certified through \\nthis program to 38 manufacturing and eight \\nnon-manufacturing facilities. \\n\\nOne of our facilities in Norway developed a \\ngreat cross-functional Waste Management team \\nthat is very active.

The cardboard \\nis used as cellulose insulation for homes and \\ncommercial buildings. While pushing the \\nmanagement of this material further up the \\nwaste hierarchy increased our overall costs \\nrather than providing cost savings, it resulted \\nin a waste reduction of nearly 200 U.S. tons \\n(193.5 U.S. tons) for these locations in 2021. We \\n\\nare continuing this initiative after 2021 and \\nproject over 200 U.S. tons of baled corrugated \\ncardboard will be sent to the third party for \\nbeneficial use every year going forward. \\n\\nReuse \\nIn Costa Rica, our team is finding ways to reuse \\nGaylord shipping containers, cutting both waste \\nproduction and costs associated with product \\ndistribution. For health and safety purposes, \\ncontainers have historically been used once. \\nHowever, our studies found that, with proper \\nsterilization methods, each container could \\nbe used twice before being disposed of. The \\nteam is now in the process of transitioning to \\nmulti-use, updating procedures for handling \\nthe shipping containers and assessing their \\ncondition prior to reuse. \\n\\nRecycle \\nIn one of our U.S. nutrition plants, prior to \\nCOVID-19, fiber drums were sent to an external \\npartner for beneficial reuse (resale). During \\nthe pandemic, these vendor activities slowed, \\nresulting in the accumulation of fiber drums \\nat our on-site Recycle Center.

To reduce \\nour raw material burden, we are optimizing \\nefficiency by minimizing the volume and \\nweight of our packaging. We are also \\nemploying circularity principles to incorporate \\nincreased quantities of recycled content and \\ndesigning for recyclability, reusability and \\nincreasingly positive impact. \\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nWe want to design our packaging with \\nsustainability in mind. Many Abbott functions \\ncollaborate to help ensure sustainability \\nconsiderations are prioritized during product \\nand packaging design and manufacture.\\n\\nEach division has provided projections for \\nthe next decade of packaging projects.

Our \\nSustainable Packaging Guiding Principles — \\nrecently created by the Sustainable Packaging \\nCouncil — inform changes to existing \\npackaging and target new designs that integrate \\nsustainability from the very beginning. \\n\\n• •  Utilize renewable materials  \\n\\n• •  Integrate recycled content\\n\\nBalance All Aspects of Packaging  \\nSystems Holistically\\n\\n• •  Optimize cube efficiency \\n\\n• •  Provide consumer direction \\n\\n• •  Improve carbon footprint\\n\\nWorking With Suppliers\\nWe’re working with suppliers to create lower \\nimpact packaging that supports our circular \\neconomy approach. Together, we identify \\nsolutions that either eliminate packaging \\nmaterials supplied to us or ensure those we \\ndo receive can be reused in manufacturing \\nprocesses. This includes optimizing design \\nto reduce material use — particularly \\nplastics — improving shipping efficiencies, \\nincreasing fiber-based packaging sustainability \\nand introducing reusable options.

We continuously monitor these \\nmaterials in our supply chain and operations \\nto ensure we are complying with relevant \\nregulations and minimizing negative outcomes. \\nOther supply chain activities — including how \\nraw materials are produced and transported — \\ncontribute to global emissions, waste \\nproduction and animal welfare issues. We \\npartner closely with key suppliers to identify \\nalternative, more responsible approaches. \\n\\nOUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH \\nTo identify and mitigate the environmental \\nimpacts of our packaging and products \\nthroughout their life cycles — and at every \\nstage of the value chain — relevant teams must \\nwork together. Our Product Stewardship, \\nSupply Chain, R&D, Engineering and EHS \\ngroups partner closely to analyze how and \\nwhat we source. \\n\\nStrategic sourcing initiatives are described in \\nthe Supply Chain section of this report on  \\npage 70. \\n\\nProduct Stewardship \\nProduct stewardship focuses on minimizing \\nuse of hazardous chemicals and substances \\nof concern, and carefully managing critical \\nmaterials in products, packaging and \\nmanufacturing processes to ensure compliance \\nwith applicable regulations. It stretches \\nfrom design through end of life, promoting a \\ncircular economy approach to our products. \\n\\nEach business conducts assessments of new \\nand changed products for substances of \\nconcern, or restricted and critical materials. \\nRisk assessments are prepared whenever these \\nsubstances are identified. We then evaluate: \\n\\n• •  Whether continued use can be justified \\n\\n• •  The value of use versus reformulation \\n\\n• •  Any potential compliance issues \\n\\nThe evaluation also serves as an opportunity \\nto research suitable alternatives and how \\nthey could impact product performance and \\ncost. Recommendations for next steps contain \\njustification for substance use, product  \\nsupport strategies and a business risk \\nmonitoring plan. These are all reviewed by \\nbusiness management. \\n\\nWe continuously monitor the regulatory \\nlandscape and any change to hazardous \\nchemical requirements. Our Corporate \\nProduct Stewardship organization holds \\nregular forums for informing all areas of our \\ncompany about the potential business impacts \\nthese changes could have.

It sets a global \\nstandard while supporting product-by-product monitoring. While we already \\nmaintain best-in-class, on-time medical device reporting (MDR), in 2021, \\nour Quality and Regulatory team established a Human Error and Reliability \\nOptimization project to target continual progress. The project introduces measures \\nto address behaviors that can contribute to human error, including:\\n• •  Examining current factors to assure on-time reporting\\n• • \\n• •  Developing in-depth investigation tools based on these categories\\n• •  Establishing a solution matrix to proactively address issues\\n• • \\n\\nImplementing a Case Reference Catalog to record learnings and support \\ndevelopment of corrective and preventative actions \\n\\n Categorizing these identified factors\\n\\nThrough this process, we will strive to achieve 100% on-time MDR across Abbott, \\nensuring regulatory compliance.\\nAdditionally, our Pharmaceuticals business uses a single pharmacovigilance (PV) \\nsystem for marketed products to monitor worldwide safety reports and ensure \\ndisclosures to relevant authorities. Information is collected on suspected adverse \\nreactions through a global database, with each case investigated and communicated \\nto relevant health authorities. This system is regularly reviewed by senior \\nmanagement while training is provided to support understanding among branded \\ngeneric medicine division employees.\\nQuality management decisions are made following product-specific safety \\nsurveillance based on predefined, risk-based criteria and applicable local legislation. \\n\\nQuality Management System \\nAbbott has implemented a Quality System \\nManual, based on established regulations and \\nindustry standards, which governs the specific \\nquality framework for each Abbott business \\nand division. The system is implemented \\nat a global level and incorporated into each \\ndivision and site. The Quality System elements \\nencompass the entire product life cycle — \\nfrom research and development, clinical \\nstudies and product design through risk \\nmanagement, material, production and process \\ncontrols and right up to distribution and post-\\nmarket surveillance. \\n\\nThe Quality Management System model and \\nmetrics are continuously reviewed to track \\nperformance at site, business and company \\nlevels. Key learnings and best practices, \\nincluding those from external intelligence, \\nare captured and applied elsewhere in our \\norganization. Where performance changes \\nare identified, we analyze root causes and take \\nnecessary corrective action. In targeted use \\ncases, we apply machine learning to enhance \\npredictions of potential risks. \\n\\nEach operating business maintains Quality \\nManagement Systems and performs audits in \\nline with governing regulations. Audits from \\nthe corporate level are also conducted. The \\nresults of all quality surveillance activities, \\nwhich are well documented, feed into \\ncontinuous improvement initiatives.\\n\\nEngaging Suppliers on Quality\\nOur suppliers play a key role in our product \\nquality and safety. A comprehensive, risk-\\nbased program ensures those that impact \\nour regulated products and/or Quality \\nManagement System conform to predefined \\nquality requirements. \\n\\nWe require suppliers to have a documented \\nQuality Management System that is \\ncommensurate with the products and services \\nthat they provide to Abbott. Continuous \\nmonitoring measures suppliers against \\nminimum performance criteria. Suppliers are \\nclassified according to risk level of potential \\nimpacts; evaluation frequency is determined \\nbased on this, ranging between every two \\n(high-risk) and four (low-risk) years. Read \\nabout how we categorize suppliers for \\nsustainability risks on page 67. \\n\\nEvaluations provide evidence that suppliers can \\ndeliver to our requirements, maintain adequate \\nQuality Management System elements and \\nconform business and process capabilities to \\nrelevant regulations and Abbott standards. On-\\nsite audits and additional agreements for high-\\nrisk partners confirm operational capabilities \\nand Quality Management System requirements. \\n\\nWe collaborate and partner with key  \\nsuppliers to continuously improve product \\nquality and safety.\\n\\nAssuring Commercial Quality \\nCommercial quality assurance (QA) ensures \\nsupply chain processes maintain product \\nquality and compliance.

Our efforts have included \\nincreasing our finished product testing; \\nconfirming process consistency; enhancing  \\nour environmental monitoring program; \\ninstalling non-porous, easily cleanable \\nsanitary floors; and implementing revised \\ntraffic control patterns to further protect the \\nmanufacturing environment.\\n\\nWe know that our decision to recall product \\nworsened the industry-wide formula shortage \\nin the U.S., and prior to restarting production \\nwe worked to get as much product as we \\ncould into the hands of parents by increasing \\nsupply at our other FDA registered facilities, \\nincluding bringing in Similac from our site \\nin Cootehill, Ireland, by air and producing \\nmore liquid Similac and Alimentum. We also \\nbegan releasing metabolic formulas that were \\npreviously on hold, to those who need these \\nunique formulas. \\n\\nThrough support from Abbott, Patient \\nAdvocate Foundation established a $5 million \\nPediatric Amino Acid Formula Emergency \\nAssistance Fund to help families of patients \\non amino acid-based formulas who’ve been \\n\\nhospitalized or encountered emergency room \\nvisits as a result of the formula shortage. The \\nfund will provide grants to help these families \\nwith medical and related living expenses.\\n\\nIn addition, we’ve offered an increased number \\nand value of coupons available for all our infant \\nformula products, including Similac ready-to-\\nfeed, to enable customers to purchase formula, \\neither free or deeply discounted. And we are \\nworking with the USDA and state Special \\nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, \\nInfants and Children (WIC) agencies and \\npaying rebates on competitive products in states \\nwhere Abbott holds the WIC contract, when \\nSimilac is not available. Abbott will continue to \\npay rebates for competitive products through \\nAugust 31. This means program participants \\nwill continue to be able to obtain formula, free \\nof charge whether it is Similac or formula from \\nanother manufacturer.\\n\\nFinally, we are making significant investments \\nto help ensure this never happens again.

Among other \\nresponsibilities, several additional groups assist \\nthe SCC in our efforts to improve supply chain \\nadaptability, resilience and flexibility. \\n\\nA Targeted Strategy \\nOur supply chain and procurement strategy \\nembeds sustainability considerations into \\nsupplier selection and management processes. \\nIt is managed by our Corporate Procurement \\nteam, a group that spans geographies, \\norganizations and business functions. \\n\\nOur strategy is designed to ensure the products \\nwe make — and what others make for us — \\nare sourced and produced ethically while \\nmitigating negative sustainability impacts.  \\nIt centers around five objectives: \\n\\n• •  Ensure our supply network aligns with, \\n\\nprotects and elevates our brand \\n\\n• •  Create relationships that deliver shared \\n\\nvalue by conducting business with \\ntransparency and trust\\n\\n• •  Enhance margins and elevate financial \\nperformance by optimizing total cost, \\nbalancing risk with return and certainty \\n\\n• •  Expedite growth and drive innovation \\n\\nthrough proprietary and exclusive \\nopportunities\\n\\n• •  Design a flexible, dynamic supply network, \\ndriving service with value and quality while \\nmitigating supply risk\\n\\nSupply Chain \\nCouncil \\n•  Composed of \\n\\nsenior leaders with \\nresponsibility for \\nthe supply chain \\nof each Abbott \\nbusiness\\n•  Makes \\n\\nrecommendations \\nfor achieving \\na sustainable, \\nresilient supply \\nchain\\n\\n•  Leads development \\n\\nof a consistent \\nglobal approach \\nto identifying \\nand managing \\nsustainability \\nopportunities  \\nand risks\\n\\nGLOBAL OPERATIONS COUNCIL\\n\\nOversees operations strategy across manufacturing, supply chain, engineering and EHS\\n\\nSupplier Diversity \\nGovernance \\nCouncil\\n•  Responsible  \\nfor growing a \\nstrong, diverse \\nsupplier base\\n\\n•  Appoints Supplier \\n\\nDiversity  \\nChampions in each \\nbusiness and major \\nspending category\\n\\nEnvironmental, \\nHealth and Safety \\n(EHS) Leadership \\nCouncil \\n•  Responsible for \\ngoverning EHS- \\nrelated topics\\n•  Composed of \\n\\nEHS leaders from  \\nall business \\ndivisions\\n\\n•  Provides expertise \\n\\nto advise supply  \\nchain assessments \\nand engagements\\n\\nPackaging \\nCommunity of \\nPractice \\n•  Responsible for \\n\\nleading packaging \\ndevelopment \\nefforts at \\ncorporate and \\ndivisional levels\\n\\n•  Drives \\n\\nimplementation \\nof Abbott’s \\n2030 sustainable \\npackaging goal \\n\\nExecutive Crisis \\nManagement Team\\n•  Responsible \\nfor managing \\nsupply chain \\nrisks for business \\ncontinuity\\n\\n•  Supported by \\n\\nGlobal Security \\norganization and \\n32 country-\\nspecific crisis \\naction teams \\n\\n64\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nOUR SUPPLIER GUIDELINE FOCUS\\n\\nEthics \\n\\n•  Business integrity and  \\n\\nfair competition\\nIdentification of worker concerns\\n\\n• \\n\\nHuman Rights and Labor\\n\\n•  Freely chosen employment\\n•  Child labor and young workers\\n•  Nondiscrimination\\n\\nHealth and Safety\\n\\n•  Animal welfare\\n•  Conflict minerals\\n•  Privacy and confidentiality\\n\\n•  Fair treatment \\n•  Wages, benefits and working hours\\n•  Freedom of association\\n\\n•  Secure, safe and healthy workplace\\n•  Accident, injury and health risk\\n\\n•  Legal and regulatory\\n\\nEnvironmental Management and Compliance\\n\\n•  Environmental management systems\\n•  Waste storage and management\\n•  Water and wastewater\\n\\n•  Air emissions\\n•  Environmental permits, licenses  \\n\\nand reporting requirements\\n\\nManagement Systems\\n\\n•  Legal and customer requirements\\n•  Risk management\\n•  Documentation\\n\\n•  Training and competency\\n•  Continuous improvement\\n•  Communication\\n\\nGuiding Responsible Suppliers\\nWe are committed to upholding the \\nfundamental principles of human rights, labor, \\nenvironmental protection and anti-corruption \\nto ensure long-term business success for \\nAbbott and our suppliers, and to improve lives \\naround the world. Our Supplier Guidelines \\nestablish our expectations of any supplier \\nwe enter a business relationship with. The \\nGuidelines align with the Ten Principles of the \\nUN Global Compact and the Pharmaceutical \\nSupply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles for \\nResponsible Supply Chain Management. \\n\\nThrough the Guidelines, we detail minimum \\nconditions to help ensure that our suppliers \\nconduct their business in an ethical manner, \\nwith integrity and in compliance with all \\nrelevant legal requirements and industry \\ncodes. In 2020, we updated our Guidelines  \\nto strengthen our focus in five key areas.\\n\\nSuppliers must be able to demonstrate \\ncompliance with our Guidelines at the request \\nand to the satisfaction of Abbott through \\nour Supplier Social Responsibility program. \\nIt is Abbott’s expectation that our suppliers \\nfully support the Guidelines and drive \\nsustainability principles across their own \\nsupply chains, systems and employee benefits. \\nThis helps ensure materials and services \\nfrom Tier 2 suppliers, and deeper, also meet \\nour requirements. \\n\\nWe embed a social responsibility clause in \\nour direct material procurement contracts. \\nThe clause details Abbott’s values and sets the \\nexpectation that vendors will comply with the \\nfocus areas of our Supplier Guidelines. It enables \\nassessment of this compliance and requires our \\nvendors to remediate any issues identified. \\n\\nAbbott’s Procurement professionals are \\nrequired to complete training on the \\nGuidelines and contract language to ensure \\nthese expectations are understood internally \\nand cascaded to our suppliers. Likewise, our \\nsuppliers are responsible for training their \\nemployees to meet the expectations detailed  \\nin the Guidelines. \\n\\nIn combination with our Supplier  \\nGuidelines, several additional policies \\nand guidelines further our supply chain \\nsustainability strategies: \\n\\n• •  Green Procurement Guidelines: \\n\\nsupport our Sourcing team to identify \\nenvironmentally preferable goods and \\nservices and request them from suppliers \\n\\n• •  Global Environmental, Health and \\n\\nSafety Policy: guides engagement with \\nstrategic stakeholders, suppliers and \\ncontractors to help ensure compliance \\nwith regulations and applicable Abbott \\nstandards to reduce EHS impacts\\n\\n• •  Supplier Diversity Guidelines: commit \\n\\nAbbott to equal opportunities for small \\nbusinesses and those owned or operated  \\nby members of underrepresented groups \\n\\n• •  Water Policy: sets supplier \\n\\nrequirements for transparency on water \\nmanagement practices \\n\\n• •  Climate Responsible Energy Guidelines: \\n\\nencourage suppliers to reduce emissions \\nand improve energy efficiency\\n\\n• •  Animal Welfare Policy: guides our work \\n\\nwith animal-related suppliers and contract \\nlaboratories, including expectations that \\nanimal use in any testing or process should \\noccur only after alternatives have been fully \\nexplored and rejected\\n\\n• •  Position Statement on Conflict Minerals: \\ndetails a process for understanding conflict \\nmineral sourcing and use, including \\nidentification of in-scope products and \\nsuppliers, supplier engagement and \\nrequirements to disclose the presence  \\nand source of conflict minerals in their \\nsupply chains\\n\\nRead more about how we ensure Abbott’s \\nstandards are upheld throughout the supply \\nchain on page 82.. \\n\\n65\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nEvolving Social Responsibility Language \\nIn 2021, we updated the language in our social \\nresponsibility clause that will be included in \\ndirect material contracts.

Using classification models, we \\nmeasure the risk levels and shared sustainability \\nimpacts of the applicable relationship.\\n\\nAll suppliers on our Approved Suppliers List are \\ncategorized as high (critical), medium or low \\nrisk. Critical suppliers are those identified as:\\n\\n• •  Supplying materials, components or \\nservices that influence the safety or \\nperformance of our products\\n\\n• •  Our only approved source of materials, \\n\\ncomponents or services \\n\\n• •  Integral to our business continuity\\n\\nSuppliers are also evaluated based on \\nsupply chain transparency and complexity, \\nalignment with certification schemes, how \\nclose they are to our customers and whether \\nthey’ve demonstrated commitment to \\nproduct security. \\n\\nOur process for confirming suppliers meet our \\nquality standards is detailed on page 58.\\n\\nA COLLABORATIVE APROACH TO RISK ASSESSMENT\\n\\nDirect and Indirect \\nSuppliers\\n•  Annual high-level ESG \\n\\n• \\n\\nrisk assessments of \\nsupply\\xa0base\\n150–300 potential \\nhigh sustainability risk \\nsuppliers surveyed to \\nunderstand management \\nsystems, programs and \\nperformance\\n\\n•  Auditing of highest \\n\\nsustainability risk \\nsuppliers completed \\nevery 1–5 years \\ndepending on industry \\nand prior performance \\n\\n•  Post-audit actions \\n\\ndetermined by program \\nand stakeholders (see \\nindividual program \\ndescriptions for details)\\n\\nNongovernmental \\nOrganizations (NGOs) \\nand Charitable \\nOrganizations\\n Collaboration  \\n• \\non initiatives \\n\\nStrategic Sourcing  \\nCategory Initiatives\\n•  Targeted initiatives \\n\\nto assess and engage \\nsuppliers operating in \\nsourcing categories  \\nwith significant \\nsustainability risks  \\nand/or opportunities\\n\\nIndustry Organizations \\n\\n• \\n\\nIndustry standard and  \\npractice alignment\\n\\n•  Knowledge sharing and  \\n\\nbest practices \\n\\n•  Supplier training \\n\\nopportunities to address \\nshared risks\\n\\n•  Shared supplier \\n\\nassessments to minimize \\nreporting burden \\non\\xa0suppliers\\n\\n67\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nRisk-Based Monitoring and Evaluation\\nWe have global policies and procedures for \\nevaluating suppliers for potential sustainability \\nissues, including those related to ethics, \\nhuman rights and labor, health and safety, \\nenvironment and management systems. Our \\nsupplier assessment programs take a risk-\\nbased approach to determine assessment, \\nmonitoring and audit requirements. They \\nconsider supplier size, maturity, industry, \\nsourcing regions, ESG performance and \\nAbbott spend. This is particularly relevant \\nto our critical suppliers, but we also assess \\nnon-critical suppliers that operate in high \\nsustainability risk industries or regions with \\npotential risk exposure.\\n\\nAbbott utilizes a third-party risk monitoring \\ntool to perform real-time analysis of critical \\nsupplier sourcing locations, tracking \\npotential geopolitical, security, sustainability, \\nenvironmental and infrastructure risks. \\nSustainability risk scores consider \\nperformance in employee autonomy, workers’ \\nrights, child labor and environmental factors. \\nWe also use the tool to monitor supply \\nchain disruptions and to identify suppliers \\nand locations that pose potential business \\ncontinuity risk. These insights then inform our \\nsourcing strategy and contingency plans.\\n\\nAdditional risk-specific analyses are performed \\nfor strategic sourcing categories and regions \\nwhen potential risks are identified. \\n\\nSupplier Survey and Audit Program \\nAbbott’s Supplier Sustainability Survey and \\nAudit Program is an ongoing effort that \\nenables global supply chain assessment and \\nengagement on a broad range of sustainability \\ntopics. Through a two-year cycle, we identify \\nand engage potential high sustainability risk \\nsuppliers, as well as those with the greatest \\nopportunities to address shared sustainability \\nimpacts, to evaluate their sustainability risks \\nand ensure business continuity. \\n\\nFirst, our global supply base is assessed, \\nconsidering overall sustainability impacts, as \\nwell as topic-specific impacts such as human \\nrights and labor, EHS risk, waste diversion \\nopportunities, climate impacts and carbon \\nmanagement. Then 150–300 potentially high \\nsustainability risk suppliers are identified \\nby our Procurement and Business teams for \\nparticipation in Abbott’s annual Supplier \\nSustainability Survey. The survey helps us \\nunderstand supplier sustainability maturity \\nand opportunities to improve supply chain \\nsustainability and resilience, covering:\\n\\n• •  Management systems\\n\\n• •  Compliance and reporting\\n\\n• •  Ethics\\n\\n• •  Human rights and labor practices\\n\\n• •  Health and safety\\n\\n• •  Environmental performance\\n\\n• •  Supply chain management\\n\\nSuppliers are determined to be “high \\nsustainability risk” when responses are not \\naligned with the expectations outlined in our \\nSupplier Guidelines. \\n\\nAfter reviewing the survey results, suppliers \\nselected for audit are notified and audited \\nby an external third-party auditor using \\nWorkplace Conditions Assessment (WCA) — \\nor other globally recognized — standards. \\nThese standards assess a supplier’s social \\nand labor conditions, health and safety, \\nenvironment and business practices at the \\nfacility level.

These programs \\nare detailed on pages 70–73. \\n\\nInsights collected through these supplier \\nassessment and engagement programs support \\nbetter supplier engagement and inform \\ndevelopment of sustainability initiatives for \\nimplementation at the supplier, sourcing and/\\nor business level. \\n\\nOUR 2021 PERFORMANCE \\nEngaging the Right Global Suppliers \\nIn 2021, 210 suppliers covering 25% of spend \\nwere engaged through Abbott’s Supplier \\nSustainability Survey. We also updated \\nthe survey to better understand risks and \\nopportunities in line with current and \\nemerging sustainability-related issues and our \\n2030 goals. \\n\\nIn addition to survey respondents, 51 high \\nsustainability risk suppliers were audited with \\noverall findings indicating Abbott is limited \\nto minimal sustainability risk based on the \\nsuppliers assessed.22 \\n\\nSafeguarding Business Continuity and \\nSupply Chain Risk Mitigation \\nRisk profiling, global event monitoring and an \\nalert system support identification of potential \\nsupply disruptions and inform proactive \\nresponses. In 2021, our risk profiling exercise \\nmore than doubled the number of supply chain \\nareas monitored. \\n\\nTo further safeguard our business and supply \\nchain against unforeseen events, we created a \\nSupply Chain Resilience program to develop \\npeople, processes and tools to evaluate and \\nengage with suppliers on identified topics. \\n2021 actions included an end-to-end risk \\nassessment for products identified as critical \\nor constituting the top 80% of revenue for \\neach business, and establishment of standard \\nmetrics for measuring internal and external \\nrisks. In total, over 50 products were profiled; \\nthis included more than 2,500 unique supply \\nchain points, such as suppliers, plants and \\ndistribution centers.\\n\\nThroughout 2021, COVID-19 remained a \\nchallenge to supply chain resilience. In \\nresponse, we maintained precautions put in \\nplace the previous year, including building an \\ninventory of raw materials and finished goods \\nto help ensure supply continuity. We continued \\nto monitor performance at manufacturing \\nsites in known COVID-19 hotspots to inform \\ncontingency plans.

Abbott \\nis a small player in the global anti-infectives \\nmarket, but recognizes our role in limiting \\nantimicrobial resistance. \\n\\nThis assessment evaluates suppliers based on \\nsupply chain criticality and environmental, \\nhealth and safety risk. Suppliers are evaluated \\nvia a questionnaire depending on the level of \\nrisk assigned. \\n\\nAn on-site visit24 may be triggered if a supplier \\nis determined high-risk from questionnaire \\nreview, if it’s had a significant incident, \\nreceived notice of violation or negative media \\nreporting, or is identified by one of our internal \\nstakeholders. Upon completion of the on-site \\nassessment, suppliers are assigned a risk status \\nand follow-up actions are determined, including \\nCAPA execution by the supplier, continuation \\nof business activities, identification of back-up \\nsuppliers and/or implementation of an exit \\nstrategy. By assessing suppliers this way, we aim \\nto minimize environmental risks and ensure \\nbusiness continuity.\\n\\nIn 2021, 48 self-assessments were completed \\nby suppliers. On-site visits of 39 suppliers — \\n16 of which were desk-based as a result of \\nCOVID — were completed by Abbott or third-\\nparty subject matter experts. Of the on-site \\nassessments completed, six were shared with \\nindustry partners through the PSCI data-\\nsharing platform.\\n\\nAddressing Supply Chain Water Risks \\nBy 2030, we aim to work with 50 key suppliers \\nin high water-stressed areas to reduce risks \\nto water quality and quantity. In 2021, we \\nconducted a water risk assessment to identify \\nkey suppliers. Using the World Resources \\nInstitute (WRI) AqueductTM Global Water Tool, \\nthis assessment considered supplier industries, \\nsourcing locations and level of water stress. \\nOf those identified, 26 suppliers representing \\n4% of total 2021 spend were engaged through \\nour Supplier Sustainability Survey to better \\nunderstand existing water risk mitigation \\nefforts and opportunities.\\n\\nAgriculture and Addressing Deforestation \\nAbbott is a leader in sustainability, with an \\ninternal surveillance program that tests above \\nindustry requirements. Our Food and Safety \\nCouncil (including representatives from \\nSupply Chain, Regulatory, and Research and \\nDevelopment) meets on a quarterly basis to \\naddress concerns related to our agriculture \\nsupply chain, including sustainability \\nissues. In part, this involves due diligence \\nof our sourcing practices and those of our \\nagricultural suppliers to better understand \\nenvironmental, social and deforestation \\nrisks, particularly for soy- and palm-\\nderived products. \\n\\n23 Includes China, Europe, India and Latin America.\\n24 On-site assessments may be repeated every 3-5 years.\\n25 Includes commercial air travel and rental cars.\\n\\nEmissions Management in  \\nOur Supply Chain\\nScope 3 emissions account for about 93% of \\nAbbott’s carbon footprint. As such, a cross-\\nfunctional team — including corporate and \\ndivisional EHS, Procurement and Supply \\nChain functions — has partnered to identify \\nour most carbon-intensive suppliers and \\nsourcing categories with the greatest \\nopportunities for emission reductions. \\n\\nIn 2021, we completed a maturity assessment \\nto understand key suppliers’ existing carbon \\nmanagement efforts and their impact on our \\nScope 3 emissions. A representative supplier \\nsample of 115 suppliers, covering 23% of \\nsupplier spend, was then engaged through \\nAbbott’s Supplier Sustainability Survey to \\nidentify opportunities for carbon reductions. \\n\\nRead more about emissions on page 43. \\n\\nRenewable Energy Procurement \\nWe are always on the lookout for renewable \\nenergy sourcing options, increasingly \\npurchasing electricity from utility providers \\nthat include above average renewable \\ngeneration in their energy mix.

Abbott’s EHS, Procurement and Supply \\nChain teams are committed to developing \\nand tracking waste diversion initiatives in \\ncollaboration with our key suppliers.\\n\\nIn 2021, we established a process and criteria \\nfor identifying suppliers with the greatest \\npotential to influence the environmental \\nimpacts of Abbott’s inbound materials \\nthat become waste from our operations. \\nOur approach included engaging Abbott \\nmanufacturing sites with significant \\nwaste production to identify the suppliers \\ncontributing the greatest impacts to our \\n\\nwaste footprint. We also broadened our scope \\nto include our largest suppliers in strategic \\nsourcing categories. \\n\\nThrough this process, we identified over \\n60 suppliers with potential inbound waste \\npartnership opportunities; a representative \\nsample of almost 40 was engaged through \\nAbbott’s Supplier Sustainability Survey to \\nidentify future opportunities to collaborate. \\n\\nPartnering With Suppliers for Reuse and \\nResponsible Waste Management\\nWe partner with waste management suppliers \\nto ensure our waste is responsibly handled \\nand disposed of and, where feasible, divert it \\nfrom landfill and incineration without energy \\nrecovery. This includes seeking opportunities \\n\\nto reuse and recycle materials and targeting \\nbeneficial-use activities, where waste is sent \\nto off-site partners for use as a substitute to \\ncommercial products and commodities. \\n\\nOur technical standard for evaluating \\nand approving vendors mandates ethical, \\nresponsible approaches to waste management \\nand aims to minimize risks associated with \\nwhat we dispose of. For manufacturing sites \\nthat produce more than 1,200 kilograms of \\nhazardous waste annually, our Waste Vendor \\nAssessment program requires on-site audits \\nof waste management firms at least every five \\nyears. This program has assessed 717 waste \\nvendors within the last five years and 139 in \\n2021. In addition, we completed 24 hazardous \\nwaste vendor on-site audits and 13 desktop \\naudits under the 2020 COVID-19 protocol \\nin 2021.\\n\\nWe maintain an IT standard specifically for \\nevaluating and approving vendors for electronic \\nwaste, ensuring responsible recycling and, \\nwhere viable, resale of IT waste. In 2021, we \\npartnered with two primary waste vendors to \\nrecycle 212 U.S. tons and resell an additional \\n67 U.S. tons of electronic equipment.\\n\\nRead more about how we’re reducing waste  \\non page 49. \\n\\nCutting the Distance Between \\nAbbott and Our Suppliers \\nFor many years, our facility in \\nthe Netherlands has relied on a \\nGermany-based bottle supplier. \\nHowever, when a packaging supplier \\nbuilt a new state-of-the-art \\nmanufacturing factory close to our \\nown manufacturing facility in 2020, \\nwe took the initiative to source \\npackaging more locally.\\nNot only has this switch reduced \\nmanufacturing lead times; it has \\ndrastically cut shipping distances by \\n217 miles for each shipment\\xa0— annual \\nsavings of 528,000 miles.

Our Anti-Corruption Compliance \\nEnhancement (ACE) program evaluates \\nspecific commercial practices to identify \\npotential compliance risks. Corruption risks \\nare also included in enterprise-wide risk \\nassessments conducted at least annually by our \\ncorporate audit group. \\n\\nEnterprise risk management (ERM) focuses on \\nrisks that have the potential to impact business \\nperformance. It continuously evaluates \\nlikelihood, impact and velocity to ensure our \\nmanagement team focuses efforts in the most \\nrelevant areas. Our ERM Network team — \\n14 functional experts led by Abbott’s Vice \\nPresident, Internal Audit — brings consistency \\nand structure to risk evaluation and integrates \\nERM throughout our business. The Vice \\nPresident, Internal Audit presents annual \\nupdates to the Audit Committee and completes \\ndetailed reviews of specific enterprise risks. The \\nBoard and its committees review enterprise risks \\nthroughout the year. \\n\\nEmerging Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nResponse\\n\\nDisruptive technologies\\n\\nTechnology is increasingly important in healthcare. As requirements for connected solutions grow, we \\nface increasing industry competition and from technology companies branching out into healthcare. The \\nimpact of the pandemic has accelerated the need for products that converge technology and healthcare \\nat an unprecedented speed. This presents a challenge where we face competitors not only in our own \\nindustry but technology players who are currently making strides into the healthcare sector. We view \\nthese challenges as an accelerator to our innovation and as an opportunity to develop products that can \\naddress health needs through meaningful innovation that is guided by patient needs. We see this as an \\nopportunity to advance Abbott solutions, partnering across industries on increasingly effective solutions. \\nThe changing landscape poses new opportunities at the intersection of healthcare and technology. The \\nconvergence of healthcare and technology has shifted the spectrum of care from hospitals and healthcare \\ninstitutions to digital solutions and remote therapy, from reacting to disease management to preventative \\ncare and wellness, and from general diagnosis to customization of care. To remain competitive, our \\ntechnologies must be science-driven, consumer-friendly, accessible, affordable and relevant. Abbott is \\ncreating solutions that enable self-diagnosis, offering devices and digital platforms that connect patients \\nand doctors and enable quicker, better-informed decisions. Our 2030 Sustainability Plan focuses on \\ndesigning access and affordability into our life-changing technologies and products. This plan requires us \\nto design our technologies and products for broader access and affordability at every step\\xa0— from every \\nphase of our R&D process, to the materials we use, to manufacturing, to the ways we reach the people \\nwho need them.\\n\\nFrom pandemic to endemic\\xa0— the new normal As COVID-19 continues to create significant impacts and uncertainties for the global economy, we have \\n\\nexecuted proactive and reactive risk mitigation strategies specifically focused on COVID-19 and novel \\nviruses to keep history from repeating itself. Increased likelihood of pandemics represents an opportunity \\nto advance research capabilities. Through the formation of the Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition\\xa0— \\nthe first of its kind\\xa0— we are able to detect threats sooner and respond quicker. In addition, we have \\ndeveloped a suite of COVID-19 testing platforms that supports multiple different diagnostic solutions for \\nthe different stages of infection and recovery. \\nWhile we continue to remain alert on the pandemic front, we must also have the foresight to prepare to \\nmove from pandemic to endemic. Our efforts in meeting the world’s COVID-19 testing demands have \\nnot detracted our investments and ability to deliver strong growths in our Medical Devices, Nutrition, \\nEstablished Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics businesses. As highlighted in our annual reports and press \\nreleases for the past two years, we have delivered a continued stream of new products and initiatives \\naround the world, signifying progress and balanced strength in all four business segments.\\n\\n77\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nEthics and Integrity \\n\\nActing ethically and with integrity is of \\nthe utmost importance to Abbott.

Each Abbott business \\nand function has OEC staff members who \\nsupport implementation of the ethics and \\ncompliance program. Outside the U.S., regional \\nOEC personnel oversee country-specific \\ncompliance requirements.\\n\\nA SHARED COMMITMENT  \\nTO INTEGRITY \\nWe want to build a culture of integrity and \\ncompliance, engaging every employee in \\nupholding ethical behaviors. Our global online \\nLegal and Ethical Resource Network (LERN) \\ntraining program is run in 91 countries and \\n32 languages. It informs employees of all \\naspects of our Code of Business Conduct, \\nwith practical guidance on recognizing and \\nresponding to legal and ethical issues. \\n\\nFull- and part-time employees are assigned \\nLERN courses based on their role and \\nresponsibilities. In 2021, over 104,000 \\nemployees completed lessons. The LERN \\ncurriculum also includes certifications on the \\ncode and conflicts of interest, with a key focus \\non interactions with healthcare professionals. \\nAll Abbott employees are expected to review \\nand sign these annually.\\n\\nIn 2021, we launched Ethics and Compliance \\nWeek to drive awareness and engage with \\nemployees on compliance-related topics \\nthrough global and region-specific initiatives. \\nEthics and Compliance Week kicked off \\nwith a company-wide email titled “Are You \\non the Right Path When it Comes to Ethics \\nand Compliance?” that was viewed by over \\n55,000 employees. This was followed by a \\nmessage from Abbott’s CECO and select \\nexecutive vice presidents on the importance \\nof integrity and upholding Abbott values, \\nwhich was available in 24 languages and \\nviewed by over 57,000 employees. Highlighting \\nEthics and Compliance Week activities in the \\nU.S., additional compliance messages were \\n\\nviewed by over 23,000 employees, inviting \\nthem to nominate Compliance Heroes who \\nlive our commitment to integrity every \\nday. The OEC received 420 nominations, \\nand ultimately recognized 27 employees as \\nCompliance Heroes. In Latin America, Ethics \\nand Compliance Week activities included an \\nOlympics of Ethics and Compliance challenge \\nthat attracted more than 4,000 participants. \\nOther regions engaged in similar activities, \\nranging from communications to interactive \\nsessions designed to reinforce compliance \\npolicies and programs. \\n\\nOn December 9, recognized as International \\nAnti-Corruption Day, Abbott’s CECO sent \\na company-wide email available in 25 \\nlanguages, raising awareness of corruption \\nand highlighting Abbott’s commitment to \\ncombat and prevent bribery and corruption. \\nThe communication included links to Abbott’s \\nAnti-Corruption Overview as well as other \\ntools such as LERN training modules, our \\nThird Party Compliance program and our \\nSpeak Up reporting tool. \\n\\nInteracting With Healthcare \\nProfessionals \\nCertain countries require additional \\ntransparency and restrict how \\nbusinesses can interact with \\nhealthcare professionals.

Assessments \\ndetermine the frequency and scope of audits. \\nWe maintain a tracking system for all action \\nitems identified to ensure business leaders are \\nheld accountable for making any necessary \\nimprovements to processes in a timely manner. \\n\\nThe OEC monitors business activities \\nthroughout the year. OEC personnel \\nsupporting each Abbott business unit and \\ncountry perform an annual risk assessment \\nto identify areas of potential compliance risk. \\nBased on assessment outcomes, they then \\nestablish monitoring plans for the year. \\n\\nOur monitoring includes selecting a risk-based \\nsampling of interactions with healthcare \\nproviders (HCPs) (such as educational events, \\nengagements with HCPs for services, and \\nprovision of sample or evaluation product) and \\nreviewing supporting documentation to assess \\ncompliance with Abbott’s policies. \\n\\nThe OEC also conducts “live monitoring” \\nprograms through which personnel directly \\nobserve HCP interactions. Issues detected \\nthrough monitoring are analyzed, investigated \\n\\nif necessary and reported to management. \\nMonitoring data are analyzed and trended over \\ntime to identify potential patterns requiring \\nfurther evaluation. The OEC assigns and tracks \\nto completion remedial actions, addressing the \\nroot causes of monitoring findings. \\n\\nProcesses for Investigations and  \\nCorrective Actions \\nAll reports of potential code violations — \\nincluding those related to discrimination and \\nharassment — by employees and third parties \\nthat perform certain services on our behalf \\nare thoroughly investigated. Where necessary, \\ncorrective actions are taken. Any employee \\nwho violates our code, policies or procedures \\nis subject to appropriate disciplinary action, \\nwhich may include termination. Employees \\nrefusing to cooperate in an investigation —  \\nor anyone who knowingly reports a false \\nconcern, or one intended to threaten, \\nintimidate or retaliate — may also be subject  \\nto disciplinary action. \\n\\nAbbott does not tolerate retaliation against \\nwhistleblowers, or anyone else who reports \\na violation in good faith. This foundational \\nprinciple is embedded in several sections \\nof our Code of Business Conduct, which \\n\\nemployees are required to certify their \\nadherence to annually. Our training courses \\non the Code of Business Conduct and Decision \\nMaking at Abbott also make reference to \\nAbbott’s stance on no retaliation. Anti-\\nretaliation language is also included in our \\nGlobal Compliance Policy on Reporting \\nConcerns and our Global Compliance \\nStandards. Anti-retaliation principles are also \\na key component in several human resource \\npolicies, including Employee Problem Solving, \\nWorkplace Harassment and Violence in the \\nWorkplace. Abbott’s Speak-Up platform, \\nwhere employees and third parties can raise \\npotential concerns, includes a message from \\nAbbott’s CECO that Abbott does not tolerate \\nretaliation against those who report concerns. \\n\\nIn addition, Abbott encourages employees to \\nreport any instances of retaliation, separately \\ninvestigates those reports and disciplines \\nemployees who have engaged in retaliation. \\nCorrective action related to Code violations, \\nincluding retaliation, may involve disciplinary \\naction up to and including termination.\\n\\n80\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nCorruption and Anti-Bribery \\n\\nAs a global healthcare company, we work \\nand interact with thousands of people \\nevery day.

Third-Party Guidelines \\ndetail the requirements we expect partners to \\nmeet. They are available through our website \\nin 18 languages. We provide training on these \\nguidelines and anti-corruption issues to third \\nparties, with a training deck developed for \\nour OEC to guide country-specific training, \\nparticularly with companies that promote our \\nproducts to healthcare providers on our behalf. \\nA new e-learning platform, which we are in \\nthe process of launching, will provide and \\ntrack online training for each third party that \\nundergoes due diligence.\\n\\nA Third-Party Compliance Process identifies \\nand addresses corruption and bribery risks \\nthat arise when interacting with government \\nofficials or healthcare providers on our \\nbehalf outside of the U.S. It requires Abbott \\nbusinesses, subsidiaries and affiliates outside \\nthe U.S. to complete due diligence before \\nengaging third-party companies. This includes \\nscreening companies, identifying high-risk \\npartners, and monitoring and mitigating any \\npotential risks. \\n\\nPotential partners are required to answer \\ndetailed questionnaires, while an external \\nvendor engaged by Abbott performs due \\ndiligence background checks. \\n\\nThe check covers risks including: \\n\\n• •  Corruption\\n\\n• •  Fraud\\n\\n• •  Organized crime\\n\\n• •  Regulatory breaches \\n\\n• •  Human rights and labor abuses\\n\\n• •  Social accountability\\n\\n• •  Arms trafficking and war crimes \\n\\n• •  Violations of government-imposed \\n\\nsanctions\\n\\n• •  Terrorism\\n\\n• •  Money laundering \\n\\n• •  Anti-competitive behavior\\n\\nWhere risks are identified, appropriate \\nremedial action is developed and implemented \\nby the OEC and our Legal team, including \\nadditional contract terms, auditing, \\nmonitoring, training or termination/rejection \\nof the third party.

The Global Security team uses state-\\nof-the-art analytics to identify and eliminate \\nunauthorized sales. In 2021, we removed \\n16,692 marketplaces, apps, websites and social \\nmedia sites selling counterfeit, diverted, \\noutdated and stolen products, and 218,128 \\nindividual product listings. \\n\\nSAFEGUARDING  \\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\\nThe following steps safeguard Abbott’s \\nintellectual property and trade secrets against \\ninternational threats: \\n\\n• •  Educating employees on trade secret \\n\\nprotection and risk-reduction strategies\\n\\n• •  Conducting Security Quality Reviews \\n\\n(SQRs) to identify critical asset risks and \\ndeveloping mitigation strategies \\n\\n• •  Supporting BUs to develop risk-mitigation \\n\\nprograms that comply with external and \\ninternal governance\\n\\nThroughout 2021, we continued to harness \\na virtual Security Quality Review (vSQR) \\nprocess we developed in 2020, completing \\naround 70 reviews of cross-business risks. Our \\nGlobal Security team launched training for all \\ncore businesses, addressing topics related to \\nInterconnected Security Services (ISS) while a \\nnew Technical Surveillance Countermeasures \\n(TSCM) program is enhancing security \\nmeasures for key sites. \\n\\nPROTECTING OUR EMPLOYEES\\nGlobal Communications Center (GCC) analysts \\nmonitor world events, providing advance \\nwarning of emerging threats and ensuring \\nemployees are safe and accounted for. Situational \\nAwareness For Everyone Everywhere (SAFEE) \\ntraining bolsters security awareness. In 2021, \\nour Global Security team provided training, \\nincluding SAFEE, to 17,000 employees. \\n\\nRegional security experts and our Travel \\nSafety program protect employees traveling \\nfor work. In 2021, the program supported \\n28,000 travelers.\\n\\nSECURING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN\\nWe are committed to eliminating criminal \\nactivities, including drug trafficking, terrorism, \\nhuman trafficking, forced child labor, cyber \\nthreats and illegal contraband from our supply \\nchain. We comply with all international \\ncustoms laws, and carefully choose our \\npartners to prevent unethical practices and \\nsecurity threats. \\n\\nOur efforts exceed U.S. Customs and Border \\nProtection (CBP) enhanced Customs Trade \\nPartnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) \\nMinimum Security Criteria (MSC). We \\npartner with CBP and an external vendor on \\na surveillance system that mitigates theft, \\ncounterfeiting and illegal diversion risks. \\nAdditionally, we remain a Tier 3 CTPAT \\npartner, enabling movement of products in \\nand out of the U.S. with expedited processing \\nand 80% fewer customs exams. Many Abbott \\nbusinesses also participate in the Authorized \\nEconomic Operator program. \\n\\nA Strategic Approach  \\nto Product and Brand \\nProtection\\nOur enforcement program is built on \\nindustry best practices and ensures \\nwe address the most significant risks. \\nEnforcement tactics include:\\n• •  Covert market surveys\\n• •  Removing counterfeit products \\n\\nand\\xa0sites \\n\\n• •  Halting sale of \\n\\nunauthorized\\xa0products \\n\\n• •  Providing contract security \\n\\nlanguage and enforcing policies \\nwith authorized resellers\\nIdentifying and removing illicit \\nactors via paid searches\\n• •  Reporting fake social \\n\\n• • \\n\\nmedia\\xa0accounts \\n\\n• •  Eliminating illegitimate and \\n\\ncybersquatted sites that could \\nharm the Abbott brand \\n\\n83\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nSecuring Our BinaxNOW Supply Chain \\nEnsuring customers always receive legitimate Abbott \\ngoods requires that we track our products at every \\nstep of the value chain. \\nThroughout 2021, we performed robust supply chain \\nrisk management processes for our BinaxNOW tests. \\nThis included securing over 8,000 shipments to \\nsuccessfully deliver almost 1 billion tests. To prevent \\nfraudulent sales, we removed 70,000 listings selling \\nillicit tests on e-commerce sites. We also partnered \\nwith eBay to ensure all test kits were automatically \\ndetected and taken down. \\nThese steps helped guarantee that the products \\ncustomers received were legitimate, safe and \\neffective, and prevented $4.6 million in losses \\nfor\\xa0Abbott. \\n\\n84\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nU.S. TRADE ORGANIZATIONS \\nWe are a member of various U.S. trade \\norganizations that engage in lobbying and \\nother political activity to champion our \\nneeds, those of our industry and those of the \\npeople who rely on Abbott solutions.

We report data from \\nacquisitions as soon as is practical. To that end, this data includes the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical, Glomed and Alere Inc. Furthermore, this data \\nreflects the divestiture of Abbott Medical Optics.\\n(a)  Abbott Fund\\n(b)  2021 marked the first year of our enhanced employee giving program. See page 35.\\n(c) \\n(d)  This includes Alere employees.\\n(e)   Legacy Alere is included in Health and Safety and Scope 3 metrics beginning in 2019. 2018 metrics do not include legacy\\xa0Alere.\\n(f) \\n\\n These percentages are as of December 31, 2020. Percentages represent a count of U.S. employees, excluding the rapid diagnostics\\xa0business.\\n\\n Annual incident rates are calculated per 100 employees, assuming the average employee works 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. This is \\nequivalent to 200,000 hours worked.\\n\\n(g)  This change represents 2021 progress toward our 2030 Goal of 30% reduction from 2018.\\n(h)  This is the percentage change from 2020 to 2021. \\n(i)  This is the baseline year.\\n(j)  Progress toward 2030 carbon goal is reported using the GHGP Scope 2 market-based methodology.\\n(k)   Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the GHGP market-based methodology. Per the GHGP, where market-based information is not available, \\n\\nlocation-based results have been used as proxy.\\n Reported Purchased Fuels Scope 1 sources consist of fuel consumed by manufacturing, R&D and warehouse facilities under Abbott’s control; sales \\nfleet; and Abbott-owned aviation.\\n\\n(l) \\n\\n(o)   Abbott’s nonenergy-consumption greenhouse gas emissions, such as refrigerant releases and process air emissions, are omitted. The total CO2 \\n\\nequivalents from nonenergy sources are noted in the Total Emissions (Scope 1 and 2) table.\\n\\n(p)   All Scope 3 calculations are adjusted to account for updated spend metrics. Sourcing category spend allocations are subject to change year over year \\n\\nin alignment with business strategy. Legacy Alere included in metrics beginning in 2019. 2018 metrics do not include legacy Alere.\\n\\n(q)  This reflects emissions from fuel combusted by manufacturing, R&D and warehouse facilities under Abbott’s control.\\n(r) \\n\\n Water-stressed locations have been determined using the WRI Aqueduct™ global water risk mapping tool. Sites rated as having high or extremely \\nhigh baseline water stress in the tool are classified as being water stressed.\\n\\n(s)  Water withdrawal is equivalent to water intake.\\n(t) \\n\\n Abbott’s diversion rate is calculated as follows: (Total Waste + Beneficial Use - Landfilled and Incineration without Energy Recovery)/Total Waste + \\nBeneficial Use. Commercial and other building activities, specific to beneficial use, are included in this rate starting in 2019.\\n\\n(u)   In 2018, data represents manufacturing, R&D and warehouse facilities under Abbott’s control. Nonmanufacturing data was not collected prior  \\n\\nto 2019.\\n\\n(v)  Waste-generation data does not include materials that are reused beneficially.\\n(w)   Abbott defines beneficial-use activities as sending material that otherwise would have been wasted off site to be used as an effective substitute for a \\n\\ncommercial product or commodity. Beneficial-use material is used as is or in substantially the same form as it was\\xa0generated.\\n The definition of “government agency inspection” was updated in 2017 by Abbott to include routine visits and sample collection from regulatory \\nagencies or designated representatives. \\n\\n(x) \\n\\n(m) Per the GHGP, Scope 1 Refrigerant CO2e emissions include only those covered in the Kyoto Protocol.\\n(n)   Reported Scope 2 sources consist of energy directly purchased by Abbott, such as electricity, steam, and hot and chilled water, as well as emissions \\n\\nfrom leased locations. Unless specified otherwise, emissions are calculated according to the GHGP Scope 2 location-based method.\\n\\n114\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index \\n\\nWe sought to prepare this report in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. \\nLinks to relevant sections in our reports and websites are included in the table below.\\n\\n2016 GRI Standard\\nGeneral Disclosures\\n2-1 \\nGRI 2:  \\nGeneral \\nDisclosures  \\n2021 \\n\\n2-2 \\n\\n2-3\\n\\n2-4 \\n2-5 \\n\\n2-6 \\n\\n2-7 \\n2-8\\n\\n2-9 \\n\\n2-10\\n\\n2-11\\n\\nGRI Disclosure\\n\\nLocation\\n\\nOrganizational details\\n\\nEntities included in \\nthe organization’s \\nsustainability\\xa0reporting \\nReporting period, frequency \\nand contact point \\n\\nhttps://www.abbott.com/contact.html\\nhttps://www.abbott.com/global-locations-contacts.html\\nForm 10-K, page 20\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Appendix, page 87\\n\\nJanuary 1–December 31, 2021\\nresponsibility@abbott.com\\n\\nRestatements of information Global Sustainability Report 2021: Metrics Endnotes, page 114\\nExternal assurance\\n\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: ESG Appendix, External Assurance, page 87\\nWe verify our EHS performance data using an independent assurance provider: Apex \\nCompanies (formerly Bureau Veritas North America).\\nAt a Glance\\nGlobal Locations & Contacts\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: About Abbott, page 7\\nForm 10-K: page 78\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Our Purpose in Action, page 4\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: ESG Appendix, Key Social Metrics, page 91\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Build the Diverse, Innovative Workforce of Tomorrow, \\npage\\xa029\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Sustainability in Everything We Do, page 14\\nProxy Statement: The Board of Directors and its Committees, pages 16–27\\nBoard of Directors & Committees\\nBoard of Directors & Committees\\nProxy Statement: The Board of Directors and its Committees, pages 16–27\\nBoard of Directors & Committees\\nProxy Statement: The Board of Directors and its Committees, pages 16–27\\n\\nActivities, value chain and \\nother business relationships \\n\\nEmployees\\nWorkers who are \\nnot\\xa0employees\\nGovernance structure \\nand\\xa0composition\\n\\nNomination and selection of \\nthe highest governance\\xa0body\\n\\nChair of the highest \\ngovernance body\\n\\n2016 GRI Standard\\nGRI 2:  \\nGeneral \\nDisclosures  \\n2021\\n\\n2-12 \\n\\nGRI Disclosure\\nRole of the highest \\ngovernance body in \\noverseeing the management \\nof impacts\\n\\n2-13 \\n\\n2-14 \\n\\n2-15 \\n2-16\\n\\n2-17\\n\\n2-18\\n\\n2-19 \\n\\n2-20\\n\\n2-21\\n\\nDelegation of responsibility \\nfor managing impacts\\n\\nDelegation of responsibility \\nfor managing impacts\\nConflicts of interest\\nCommunication of \\ncritical\\xa0concerns \\n\\nCollective knowledge of the \\nhighest governance body \\n\\nEvaluation of the \\nperformance of the highest \\ngovernance body\\nRemuneration policies\\n\\nProcess to determine \\nremuneration\\n\\nAnnual total \\ncompensation\\xa0ratio\\n\\nLocation\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: ESG Appendix, Materiality, page 88\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: ESG Appendix, Stakeholder Engagement, page 89\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Sustainability in Everything We Do, page 14\\nProxy Statement: The Board of Directors and its Committees, pages 16–27\\nCDP Climate Change Response: (C1.2a)\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Sustainability in Everything We Do, page 14\\nProxy Statement: The Board of Directors and its Committees, pages 16–27\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Governance and Sustainability Foundations, page 74\\n\\nGovernance Guidelines webpage: Director Responsibilities and Code of Business Conduct\\nProxy Statement: The Board of Directors and its Committees, pages 16–27\\nGlobal Sustainability Report 2021: Processes for Reporting Concerns, page 79\\nDue to confidentiality constraints, Abbott does not report the total number and nature \\nof critical concerns.

We aim to reach as many people as possible who need these healthcare solutions. \\nAs part of our 2030 Sustainability Plan, we have an intentional focus on designing sustainable access and \\naffordability into our new life-changing technologies so that we can make them widely available at affordable prices \\nto people who need them. Pricing, however, is only one of the factors that determine affordability. Abbott also \\nis advocating for systems and approaches that broaden access while minimizing additional costs for consumers \\nand\\xa0payers. \\nIn 2021, Abbott’s product pricing reflected the company’s approach, with an annual global net sales price change of \\n-1.5%, which compares to a Global Consumer Price Index (CPI) of +3.9% for 2021. This metric is modified from the \\nmetric provided by SASB by substituting a global CPI for the U.S. CPI. \\nSales outside of the U.S. in 2021 comprised approximately 61% of Abbott’s revenue. Abbott believes that disclosing \\nproduct pricing relative to the Global CPI is an appropriate way for investors and other stakeholders to best \\nunderstand pricing for products across our diversified, global businesses. The global CPI is the total headline CPI for \\neach country weighted by Abbott’s geographic revenue exposure. For more on Abbott pricing, see Abbott’s 10-K \\nfiling for 2021.\\n\\n2021 Disclosure \\nAbbott Laboratories sells diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. (For \\nmore details, see page 20 in our Innovate for Access and Affordability section in this report.) Given the breadth of \\nour product offerings, each Abbott division sells products using a variety of contracting methodologies. Divisions \\nuse a variety of price concessions in their sales contracting, including point-of-sale discounts, rebates and wholesaler \\nchargebacks. These price concessions can be for single or multi-product sales and may include products from \\nmultiple business units or divisions (such as all medical device business units or rapid and molecular diagnostics). \\nPrice concessions may be based upon factors such as volume, market share and purchase commitments, or result \\nfrom competitive bidding processes, and are generally documented in executed contracts, purchase orders and \\nterm sheets. Point-of-sale discounts are reflected in invoices that show the discounted prices, and rebates are \\ndocumented in written agreements, with rebate calculations provided at the time rebate payments are made. \\nOur customers span the globe and include federal, state and local governments, hospitals, group purchasing \\norganizations, wholesalers, individual healthcare providers and consumers. We maintain pricing flexibility to meet the \\nneeds of our diverse customers, large and small, and to ensure that our essential healthcare products are available \\nand affordable across the globe.\\n\\nProduct Safety\\nHC-MS-250a.1: Number of \\nrecalls issued, total units recalled.\\n\\nBusiness \\nMed Device\\nDiagnostics\\nPharmaceutical2\\nNutrition\\n\\nFDA Class I and Class II \\n\\nClass I\\n1\\n1\\nN/A\\n0\\n\\nClass II\\n3\\n6\\nN/A\\n0\\n\\n124\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (SASB) INDEX CONTINUED\\n\\nMetric\\nHC-MS-250a.2: List of products \\nlisted in the FDA’s MedWatch \\nSafety Alerts for Human Medical \\nProducts database.\\n\\nHC-MS-250a.3: Number of \\nfatalities related to products \\nas reported in the FDA \\nManufacturer and User Facility \\nDevice Experience database.\\n\\nHC-MS-250a.4: Number \\nof FDA enforcement actions \\ntaken in response to violations \\nof current Good Manufacturing \\nPractices (cGMP), by type.\\n\\n2021 Disclosure \\nSee the FDA’s MedWatch safety alerts for human medical products database. \\n•  Potential for False Positive Results with Abbott Molecular Inc.

We train employees and clinical sites on the proper conduct of clinical studies and employ both external \\nand internal oversight of studies. \\nWhen planning our clinical studies, Abbott identifies and reduces controllable risks to patients. Either our \\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) or our Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) reviews any proposed research prior \\nto commencement to assure patient protections. The informed consent procedures and consent form documents \\nfor any clinical study must conform to all relevant legal statutes and governmental regulations. During the course \\nof a study, patients can report any concerns to the IRB. We monitor our studies on an ongoing basis to ensure \\ncompliance with Abbott standards and identify any unforeseen risks to patient safety.\\nThis includes audits of contract research organizations (CROs) that conduct or manage studies on behalf of Abbott. \\nIf Abbott becomes aware of study misconduct, we report it to the appropriate authorities. No GCP inspections by \\nregulatory agencies of the company or clinical trial investigators led to fines, penalties, warning letters or product \\nseizures in 2021. \\nClinical Trial Registrations  \\nAbbott registers all applicable and/or covered clinical trials, regardless of outcome, in a publicly accessible clinical \\ntrials registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. For branded generic pharmaceuticals, this means that we register \\ninterventional clinical studies in patients as designated by national laws and regulations.

In 2021, our Nutrition business (1) utilized 138,000 U.S. tons of material to place 3.7 billion packages \\non market, (2) made 19% of packaging from recycled and/or renewable materials and (3) estimated that 65% of its \\npackaging is recyclable, reusable and/or compostable.\\n\\nWe recognize the impact our packaging has on the environment today in the form of resource use, related emissions \\nand waste production. We are rethinking how we design packaging to optimize material use and keep materials in \\ncirculation for as long as possible. To reduce raw material burden, we are optimizing efficiency by minimizing the \\nvolume and weight of our packaging. We are also employing circularity principles to incorporate increased quantities \\nof recycled content and designing for recyclability, reusability and increasingly positive impact. \\nTo address 50 million pounds of packaging through high-impact sustainable design programs, we need a plan of \\naction.

We maintain an identification process for opportunities to address emerging climate change-\\nrelated healthcare needs and increase operating efficiencies by reducing climate-related impacts. We have determined that \\nclimate-related risks and opportunities exist at site and regional levels but are limited at a global scale. \\n\\nRISKS\\nWe analyze physical and transitional risks resulting from emerging regulation and new supplier/customer expectations \\nof our businesses and risk exposure. We assess and manage them through our integrated company-wide risk management \\nprocess, which identifies opportunities to build resilience in both our operations and our business model. We regularly \\nupdate risk management policies, standards and programs to align with global best practices and regulatory requirements, \\nand aim to anticipate emerging risks and upcoming regulatory changes. Our enterprise risk management (ERM) \\nprocess identifies and evaluates the most critical business risks and provides guidance to our Board of Directors and \\nmanagement team. \\n\\nThe EHS Governance team monitors emerging climate-related trends and regulations to analyze potential impacts and \\nrisk exposure, and develop appropriate management strategies. Our EHS, Economics, Business Continuity and Supply \\nChain organizations use scenario-sensitivity risk modeling to understand the financial implications of climate-related risks. \\nAbbott’s Business Continuity and Crisis Management organizations implement measures to ensure business continuity \\nand minimize the financial impacts of physical climate-related risks. These physical risks fall into two categories: acute \\nand chronic. \\n\\n• • \\n\\n  Acute physical risks associated with climate change include unforeseen extreme weather events for which we cannot \\ndevelop preventative strategies. We have developed strategies for mitigating and responding to them across our value \\nchain. Our Business Continuity and Crisis Management organization works with our EHS, Engineering and Supply \\nChain groups to strengthen business resiliency against weather events and other forms of extreme disruption. During \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and strict travel restrictions, our processes enabled us to quickly produce millions of COVID-19 \\ntests while continuing to provide our other essential products to people globally.\\n\\n• • \\n\\n  Our Engineering and EHS policies and management standards consider chronic physical risks, such as water scarcity, \\nand require sites to conduct regular risk and opportunity evaluations and implement mitigation strategies. \\n\\nClimate-related risk analyses conclude that Abbott is not exposed to physical risks that could generate a substantive change \\nin business operations, revenue or expenditure at a corporate level. While limited physical risks exist at site and regional \\noperation levels and throughout our supply chain, our diverse geographical distribution significantly mitigates the potential \\nfor substantive business impact.\\n\\nOur most significant climate-related risks are transition risks that relate to emerging expectations and regulations around \\nGHG emission management. These include carbon limits and taxes, enhanced reporting obligations, costs to transition to \\nlower-emissions technologies, and increased costs of goods and services. We have identified the need to manage and mitigate \\nenvironmental impacts as a potential enterprise risk. In response to this, our business strategy includes reducing operational \\nenergy and carbon footprint, and engaging our value chain in strategic sourcing categories.\\n\\nOPPORTUNITIES\\nAs part of our product research and development (R&D) and climate risk management processes, we consider climate \\nchange-related opportunities. These fall into two main categories: \\n\\n• •  Increased operating efficiencies through achieving carbon reduction targets \\n\\n• • \\n\\n The opportunity to advance our mission to help people live their best lives by meeting changing healthcare and \\nnutrition needs\\n\\n130\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nTASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD) RESPONSE CONTINUED\\n\\nCompared with many industries, Abbott’s carbon footprint is relatively small, reducing opportunities to achieve significant \\nimprovements in operating efficiencies and cost savings. Although opportunities exist and are incorporated into our 2030 \\nSustainability Plan, they are unlikely to have a substantive financial impact on our business. \\n\\nClimate changes have the potential to influence disease burden and result in increased need for the diagnostics, medical \\ndevices, nutrition products and pharmaceuticals that Abbott makes. Our 2030 Sustainability Plan commits us to continually \\nrespond to increased humanitarian needs due to severe weather events, new disease threats and changes in the spread \\nof disease. We will do so in line with our priority of innovating for access and affordability, which has characterized our \\ncompany’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not anticipate that changes to the disease burden resulting from \\nclimate change will have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business beyond this.

Throughout 2021, we expanded our IT and \\nComputer Science internship in the U.S., with plans to bring our Engineering \\nco-op program to more applicants. In 2021, 1,375 young people participated in our \\ninternship programs. \\n\\nSee page 31 of Abbott’s Workforce section for more information.\\n\\nEqual Employee Development \\nWe offer our employees opportunities to develop and progress at Abbott, no matter \\nwhat their career goals. In 2021:\\n•   We achieved 163,315 development and job opportunities for current and \\n\\nfuture employees. \\n\\n•  15% of all open positions were filled internally. \\n•  40% of global management positions were filled by women. \\n•   33% of leadership roles were held by people from underrepresented groups. \\n•   $3.5 million in employee savings contributions were made through our Freedom 2 \\n\\nSave program. \\n\\n•  We recorded 44.6% female representation in STEM roles. \\n•  70% of former college interns hired as full-time engineers were women.\\n\\nSee page 30 of Abbott’s Workforce section for more information. \\n\\nSEWA \\n In India, we have supported our partner, SEWA, by building three livelihood \\nearning programs that support over 1,500 women by providing them employment. \\nThese women serve across the supply-chain to bring SEWA members’ products \\nand produce to the market, stitching masks and putting food packets together for \\neconomically-disadvantaged communities. \\n\\nSee page 6 of the About Abbott section for more information.\\n\\nFuture Well Communities \\nTo address the diabetes epidemic in Stockton, California, we are partnering with \\nUniversity of the Pacific to create certificate and degree programs in diabetes \\nmanagement, provide scholarships and secure employment for at least 80% of \\ngraduating scholars within three months post-graduation.\\n\\nSee page 22 of Abbott’s Innovate for Access and Affordability  section for more \\ninformation.\\n\\n138\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDG) INDEX CONTINUED\\n\\nRESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND \\nPRODUCTION \\nENSURE SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION AND \\nPRODUCTION PATTERNS\\n\\nTARGET\\n\\n12.5\\n\\nWHY IT MATTERS\\n\\nEach stage of a product’s life cycle has potential impacts on human health and the \\nenvironment — from how materials are harvested to how final products and services \\nare consumed. We believe waste management responsibility extends beyond the \\nmanufacturing phase, and are committed to staying accountable for impacts at each \\npoint of a product’s journey. \\n\\n2030 ABBOTT GOAL\\n\\n•   Address 50 million pounds of packaging through high-impact sustainable design \\nprograms that: employ circularity principles through smart design and material \\nselection; eliminate and reduce materials; improve the energy efficiency of \\nAbbott’s products; optimize packaging, pallet and truckload efficiency. \\n\\n•   Reduce waste impacts using a circular economy approach to achieve and maintain \\n\\nat least a 90% waste diversion rate.\\n\\n•   Engage with key suppliers to reduce the environmental impact of materials \\n\\nsupplied to Abbott that become waste in our operations.\\n\\nPROGRESS AND 2021 STORIES \\n\\nResponsibility in Procurement\\nIn 2021, we expanded the Supply Chain Sustainability team within our Global \\nProcurement organization, and continued partnering with Operations, Supply Chain \\nand EHS functions to manage our supply chain sustainability strategy, governance \\nand programming. We also established a network of Sustainability Liaisons to act as \\nrepresentatives for each of our businesses in support of our 2030 targets and supply \\nchain initiatives. \\n\\nWaste Management Progress \\nWhile waste production did increase in 2021 due to increased production, as well as \\nan increase in construction waste from expansion projects to allow for production \\ngrowth, seven manufacturing facilities and one non-manufacturing facility received \\nZero Waste-to-Landfill certification, bringing our total number of facilities certified \\nthrough this program to 38 manufacturing and eight non-manufacturing facilities. \\nWe follow the principles of reduce, reuse, recycle.\\n• \\n\\n Reduce: At both the Abbott Park corporate headquarters and our Core \\nDiagnostics operations in Illinois, we started an initiative in March of 2021 to \\nreduce the generation of waste from these sites by sending baled corrugated \\ncardboard to a third party for beneficial use. \\n\\n•   Reuse: In Costa Rica, we have updated procedures to allow for the reuse of \\n\\nshipping containers.\\n\\n•   Recycle: In one of our U.S. nutrition plants, we have invested in machinery \\n\\nto enable on-site breaking down of fiber drums to support better recycling of \\neach component.\\n\\nSee page 49 of Abbott’s Environment section for more information. \\n\\n139\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDG) INDEX CONTINUED\\n\\nCLIMATE ACTION \\nTAKE URGENT ACTION TO COMBAT CLIMATE \\nCHANGE AND ITS IMPACTS\\n\\nTARGET\\n\\n13.1 / 13.2\\n\\nWHY IT MATTERS\\n\\nWe are committed to safeguarding a healthier planet for everyone. One way we do \\nthis is by reducing our emissions, finding more efficient ways to use energy and \\nlimiting reliance on fossil fuels.\\n\\n2030 ABBOTT GOAL\\n\\n•   Reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% compared to our 2018 \\n\\nbaseline. This aligns our sustainability plan with the objectives of the Science \\nBased Targets initiative (SBTi).\\n\\n•   We are developing a 2030 target for Scope 3 emissions and will work with our \\nkey carbon-intensive suppliers to implement sustainable programs to reduce \\nthese emissions.\\n\\nPROGRESS AND 2021 STORIES \\n\\nEmission Reductions\\nThroughout 2021, absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased by 3.3% compared \\nto 2020. When adjusted for sales, Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased 17% over \\nthis same time period. In 2021, as our products — including COVID testing and \\ndiagnostics — became increasingly important for patients and healthcare workers \\nglobally, we expanded production, which has come with a rise in emissions. \\n\\nEnergy Efficiency\\nTo reduce energy demand, we have made several energy-efficient improvements \\nas retrofits to existing equipment or through active in-house energy management. \\nSeveral sites use energy data and innovative methods to identify and quantify \\nenergy inefficiencies in manufacturing processes, often employing external experts. \\nThese insights then inform a list of priority energy demand reduction projects \\nacross the global business. For example, in Indonesia, many of our motors have \\nbeen upgraded with variable speed drives, reducing energy requirements while \\nretaining performance.\\n\\nRenewable Energy \\nWe are committed to purchasing a greater proportion of electricity from renewable \\nsources and are developing a Renewable Energy Procurement initiative to drive \\ncontinuous improvement in this area. In 2021, we purchased 190 million kWh of \\nlow-carbon and renewable energy, resulting in savings of 80,000 metric tons of \\nCO2e. In addition, we also generated 1.8 million kWh from solar installations at eight \\nof our sites. \\n\\nSee page 45 of Abbott’s Environment section for more information on our 2021 \\nprogress for climate action and our latest CDP Climate Change response. \\n\\n140\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ABOUT\\n\\nACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY\\n\\nDATA\\n\\nWORKFORCE\\n\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nQUALITY AND SAFETY\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nESG APPENDIX\\n\\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDG) INDEX CONTINUED\\n\\nPARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS\\nSTRENGTHEN THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION \\nAND REVITALIZE THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP \\nFOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\\n\\nTARGET\\n\\n17.6 / 17.17\\n\\nWHY IT MATTERS\\n\\nCollaboration is key to mitigating shared impacts. We work side by side with those \\nwe serve, governments and other stakeholders to address health disparities and \\nbarriers to equitable healthcare access.

We also updated the survey to better understand risks and \\nopportunities in line with current and emerging sustainability-related issues and our \\n2030 goals.\\n\\nSee page 69 of Abbott’s Supply Chain section for more information.\\n\\nAccess and Affordability Partnerships \\n The Health Equity Bill of Rights — established by the American Diabetes \\nAssociation® (ADA) — posits ten basic rights for people with diabetes and \\nprediabetes. We have sponsored a pilot initiative designed by the ADA to address \\nright #9: The right to the latest medical advances \\n\\nToday, Black Americans are 60% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes, yet much \\nless likely to have their condition well managed. The goal of our three-year, $5 million \\neffort is to reduce health inequities by removing barriers to tools and technology \\nfor diabetes management regardless of income level or insurance status.  The pilot \\nseeks to better understand and address the healthcare disparities for Black people \\nliving with diabetes. Focusing initial efforts in Columbus, Ohio, we will help by \\nsponsoring campaigns to enhance awareness, access to, and adoption of these tools. \\nIn collaboration with the National Center for Urban Solutions (NCUS), 150 Black \\nresidents living with diabetes will have access to health education, physical training, \\nnutritional support and Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitoring technology. \\n\\nSee page 18 of Abbott’s Access and Affordability section for more information.\\n\\n141\\n\\n\\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Abbott Sustainability  \\n100 Abbott Park Road  \\nDepartment 0383  \\nAbbott Park, IL 60064-6048 \\n\\nresponsibility@abbott.com\\n\\nwww.abbott.com/sustainability\\n\\n\\x0c\"}"
