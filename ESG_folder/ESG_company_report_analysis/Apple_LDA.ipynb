    "# Analysing ESG report using Natural Language Processing\n",
    "by Chee-Foong on 12 Mar 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Environment, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) refers to the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business.  These criteria help to better determin the future financial performance of companies (return and risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis extracts text from a ESG report in PDF format from the internet, performs NLP on these information, summaries the key ESG initiatives with WordClouds, TDIDFs and discovers topics by building a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep this exercise as simple as possible, only one ESG report is being used.  Specifically the [Citibank's 2019 ESG report](https://www.citigroup.com/citi/about/esg/download/2019/Global-ESG-Report-2019.pdf?ieNocache=967).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that ESG is a broad topic.  Different companies focus on different aspects of ESG depending on their business operations and culture.  One can potentially ingest more ESG reports from different companies across all sectors and industries to capture relevant ESG topics.  This to be attempted in another analysis.\n",

We work  \\nwith teachers, advocates, and entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds as part of our Racial Equity and Justice \\nInitiative.

And at \\nthe 26th UN Climate Change Conference of \\nthe Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, \\nin 2021, Apple called for bold government \\naction on climate change, joining several new \\ninitiatives, including the First Movers Coalition, \\nthe Forest Investor Club, and the Clean Energy \\nDemand Initiative.\\n\\nWe also advocate for country-specific measures \\nthat motivate climate action. For example, \\nwe’ve called for enhanced climate ambition \\nand renewable energy deployment in Japan’s \\nBasic Energy Plan and Nationally Determined \\nContribution (Japan’s plan to reduce emissions \\nin furtherance of the Paris Agreement), and for \\n\\nApple’s Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, Lisa Jackson, alongside President Joe Biden \\nand other leaders from around the world at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference.

As \\njust one recent example, we’ve continued \\nour public support for LGBTQ+ equality by \\nworking with The Human Rights Campaign \\nand other organizations to support LGBTQ+ \\nequality protections and oppose discriminatory \\nproposals. This includes legislative advocacy \\nat the federal and state levels, and working \\nwith coalitions of businesses to stand against \\nwhat we believe to be harmful and divisive \\nlegislation that threatens individuals, families, \\nand communities. Most recently, that included \\nsending a letter to Texas leadership opposing \\nlaws that discriminate against the LGBTQ+ \\ncommunity. Read more here. \\n\\nProtecting our customers\\nIn the U.S., the legal system is one avenue \\nthrough which Apple can take action to support \\nour values. For example, in January 2022, \\nApple, along with other leading companies, \\nfiled an amicus brief in support of the EPA’s \\nauthority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions \\nbecause that authority “is critical to combatting \\nclimate change.”\\n\\nIn November 2021, Apple filed a lawsuit against \\nNSO Group and its parent company to hold it \\naccountable for the surveillance and targeting \\nof Apple users. The complaint provides new \\ninformation on how NSO Group infected victims’ \\ndevices with its Pegasus spyware. To prevent \\nfurther abuse and harm to its users, Apple is \\nseeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO \\nGroup from using any Apple software, services, \\nor devices. \\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Our commitment to human rights\\n\\nOur commitment begins with \\ntreating everyone with dignity \\nand respect.

A number of teams are responsible \\nfor carrying out human rights due diligence, \\nincluding the Privacy, Corporate, and \\nCompliance teams within Apple’s Legal and \\nGlobal Security organization, as well as Apple’s \\nEnvironment and Supply Chain Innovation (ESCI) \\nteam within Worldwide Operations.\\n\\nOur commitment to civil rights\\nWe are deeply committed to building a more \\njust and inclusive world and are moving forward \\nwith plans to conduct a civil rights audit.\\n\\nApple’s Human Rights Policy\\nOur Human Rights Policy governs how we treat \\neveryone, including our customers, employees, \\nbusiness partners, and people across our \\nsupply chain. We’re deeply committed to \\nrespecting internationally recognized human \\nrights in our business operations, as set out \\nin the United Nations (UN) International Bill of \\nHuman Rights and the International Labour \\nOrganization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental \\nPrinciples and Rights at Work.

We \\nalso seek to remedy adverse impacts, track \\nand measure our progress, and report our \\nfindings.

In 2021, we \\ncontinued to improve the carbon efficiency of \\nthe integrated circuits we use in our products \\n— components we’ve prioritized because they \\nare carbon-intensive. For example, switching \\nto the Apple M1 chip for the 13-inch MacBook \\nPro reduced the energy needed to manufacture \\nand use the device, driving down the product’s \\ncarbon footprint by over 8 percent.\\n\\nWe’ve continued to expand our use of \\n100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures \\nof a number of products. All iPad models in our \\nlineup now use 100 percent recycled aluminum \\nin their enclosures — joining Apple Watch \\nSeries 7, Apple Watch SE, MacBook Air, Mac \\nmini, and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro \\ndevices.

We’ve focused our \\nefforts to source renewables around several \\nkey pillars: creating new renewable energy \\nprojects, undertaking projects that deliver clear \\nbenefits to local communities, and supporting \\nrenewable energy innovations. About 1.5 \\ngigawatts of Apple-created renewable \\nelectricity projects account for over 90 percent \\nof the renewable electricity our facilities use.\\n\\nDirect emissions abatement\\nTo address the non-electricity emissions \\nassociated with our materials and \\nmanufacturing processes, we seek \\ntechnological solutions through emissions \\nabatement or switching to low-carbon fuel \\noptions. For example, we partnered with \\naluminum companies and the governments \\nof Canada and Quebec to help fund research \\nand development for ELYSIS, a technology that \\neliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions \\nfrom aluminum smelting.\\n\\nWe continue to experience tremendous \\nprogress toward our goal of transitioning our \\nmanufacturing supply chain to 100 percent \\nrenewable electricity by 2030. As of March \\n2022, 213 manufacturing partners in 25 \\ncountries have committed to 100 percent \\nrenewable energy for Apple production.\\n\\nOver 70 percent of companies on Apple’s \\nSupplier List — those suppliers that make \\nup 98 percent of Apple’s direct spend for \\nmaterials, manufacturing, and assembly of \\nour products worldwide — have committed to \\n100 percent renewable electricity. In addition, \\nmany other smaller suppliers have also made \\nthese commitments.\\n\\nMany components essential to products like \\nours, including integrated circuit chips and \\ndisplay panels, currently rely on manufacturing \\nprocesses that use fluorinated gases, which \\nhave high global warming potential. We’re \\npartnering closely with key manufacturers \\nto prevent these gases from being \\nreleased into the atmosphere by optimizing \\nmanufacturing processes and deploying \\nabatement technologies.\\n\\nTo address emissions from shipping products \\nto our customers, we’re shifting whenever \\npossible toward less carbon-intensive shipping \\nmodes, such as rail and ocean. And we’re \\nseeking out technical innovations, including \\nalternative fuels and electric vehicles. In fiscal \\nyear 2021, Apple avoided 180,000 metric tons \\nof CO2e by shifting the mode of transport and \\nreducing product weight through the removal  \\nof the power adapter from the box of \\niPhone devices. \\n\\nProviding access to clean energy in South Africa \\nEven a few years ago, not everyone in one community in South Africa had electricity  \\nat home. Many people had been using battery-powered lanterns because upfront costs \\nand other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach. As we worked with our \\npartners to identify new renewable energy projects for our Power for Impact program,  \\nwe saw exciting potential in this community. \\n\\nOur partner on the ground, DC GO, a solar energy provider based in Johannesburg,  \\ngot to work meeting members of the community and learning more about their needs. \\nUltimately, DC GO developed a pay-as-you-go model that brought solar energy to 3500 \\nhomes that previously lacked access. This was possible only because of the way they  \\nbuilt relationships with community members and worked with Apple to price the solution  \\nin line with what people were already spending on batteries for their lanterns.\\n\\nIn addition, DC GO hired and trained local people for jobs in sales, maintenance,  \\nand other roles that not only created local jobs but also helped to make sure the project \\n — and the community’s access to electricity — would be sustainable over time.  \\nThis is just one example of how the Power for Impact program is working to benefit \\ncommunities, our company, and the environment at the same time.

It can be stressful if something at Apple \\nhas a negative effect on well-being, violates an Apple policy, or interferes with someone’s \\nability to do their best work. There are several ways team members can report a concern:\\n\\nManagers: Talking to a manager is a good place to start. A large part of their responsibility \\nis to support their team members. If a team member is not comfortable bringing a concern \\nto their manager, they can discuss it with any manager at Apple.\\n\\nPeople Support: This dedicated team specializes in supporting Apple team members with \\nwork-related topics. They can answer questions, clarify a policy, or suggest resources or \\noptions to help resolve a problem.  \\n\\nBusiness Conduct: Team members can contact the Business Conduct team via phone, \\nemail, or a third party. They will review the concern and share it with the appropriate internal \\npartners. Read more on page 72.\\n\\nPeople Business Partner: Team members can discuss the issue with their People \\nBusiness Partner (PBP), particularly if it’s related to your team or organization.\\n\\nTeam members are encouraged to raise their concerns in the way they feel most \\ncomfortable, internally or externally. In addition to the options above, they may also contact \\nany of the government agencies or other external organizations that address employee and \\nworkplace concerns.\\n\\nWorkplace practices \\nand\\xa0policies \\n\\nApple’s culture is built on treating everyone with \\ndignity and respect, and this focus shapes how \\nour colleagues engage with one another and \\nwith our customers and partners around the \\nworld. We’re also committed to respecting our \\nteam members’ rights as set out in our Human \\nRights Policy.\\n\\nEqual employment opportunity \\nApple is an equal opportunity employer \\ncommitted to inclusion and diversity.  \\n\\nWe take steps to provide equal opportunity \\nfor all applicants and employees, without \\nregard to race, color, ancestry, national origin, \\ncaste, religion, creed, age (over 40), mental \\nand physical disability, sex, gender (including \\npregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related \\nmedical conditions), sexual orientation, gender \\nidentity or expression, medical condition, \\ngenetic information, marital status, military \\nor protected Veteran status, an employee’s \\nreproductive health decisions or those of  \\ntheir dependents, or on any other basis \\nprotected by law. We provide reasonable \\naccommodations to applicants and employees \\nwith physical and mental disabilities. \\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   30\\n\\nHarassment and discrimination \\nWe are committed to providing a workplace free \\nof harassment or discrimination based on race, \\ncolor, ancestry, national origin, caste, sex, gender \\n(including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, \\nor related medical conditions), sexual orientation, \\ngender identity or expression, religion, creed, age \\n(over\\xa040), mental and physical disability, medical \\ncondition, genetic information, marital status, or \\nmilitary or protected Veteran status, or on any \\nother basis protected by law. We do not tolerate \\ndiscrimination or harassment of our employees or \\nthose with whom we have a business, service, or \\nprofessional relationship (including customers), \\nnor do we tolerate workplace violence of any kind. \\nRetaliation against anyone for complaining about \\nharassment or discrimination, or for participating \\nin the investigation of a complaint of harassment \\nor discrimination, is against Apple policy and will \\nnot be tolerated at Apple. \\n\\nVoluntary decision review \\nApple’s voluntary decision review enables \\nemployees to have an employment decision \\nreevaluated. This is designed to promote \\nfairness and impartiality, in line with our values \\nand policies. The reviewer will consider any  \\nnew information that indicates the decision  \\nmay not have been in accordance with our \\npolicies and guidelines. \\n\\nNon-employees  \\nand temporary workers\\nIn addition to our full-time employees, \\ntemporary workers and vendor services play an \\nimportant role on our team. Our temporary \\nworkers generally perform similar work as our \\nfull-time employees, as they are intended to \\naugment the Apple employee workforce under  \\na short to mid-term assignment. Approximately \\n\\n6 percent of our U.S. corporate workforce \\nwere temporary workers as of October 2021. \\nTemporary workers have the same opportunity \\nto be considered as all other applicants to any \\nApple job posting whether that opportunity is \\na conversion of their current role or a role they \\nfound on our job site. And in our retail business, \\nwe have a strong record of hiring temporary \\nworkers as full- and part-time employees. \\n\\nOur outsourced services with workers provided \\nvia vendors generally perform work that can be \\ndifferent from that performed by our permanent \\nemployees. This workforce is intended to \\nsupport business needs where specific skills \\nare required and the vendors have the ability  \\nto scale with our varied business needs.\\n\\nPay and benefits: For vendor services, pay \\nrates are managed by the vendor. Various \\nbenefits, including but not limited to healthcare, \\nare offered to these workers through their \\nemployer or staffing agencies. Vendors are \\nalso accountable to Apple’s Supplier Code \\nof Conduct, which requires that our staffing \\nagencies are compliant with all current local \\nand national legislation and employment laws, \\nincluding wage and benefits requirements, for \\ntheir employees (see page 37 or People and \\nEnvironment in Our Supply Chain).\\n\\nRaising concerns: In many cases there are \\nmultiple avenues for non-Apple workers to \\nreport problems anonymously, including internal \\nprocesses with their employer and the Apple \\nBusiness Conduct Helpline (see page 72).\\n\\nPerformance: Vendor performance is \\nreviewed and evaluated by the vendor \\nmanagement based on feedback sometimes \\nreceived from Apple managers, Procurement, \\nand/or Supplier Responsibility. \\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Apple’s \\nCOVID-19 \\nresponse\\n\\nProtecting each other’s health\\nAt every stage of the pandemic, our first \\npriority has always been the health of our \\nteams, customers, and communities. That \\nmeant being one of the first companies to \\nclose our offices and retail stores, and finding \\ninnovative ways to connect with colleagues and \\ncustomers virtually.\\n\\nSince 2020, we’ve continued our efforts and \\nprograms to support our people. We adopted \\nCDC recommendations around up-to-date \\nvaccinations, including booster doses. Apple \\nalso continued to pay our teams during \\ntemporary store and office closures, expanded \\nour paid leave policies, and enhanced our \\npolicies and procedures for a safe work \\nenvironment — both in the office and in-store.\\n\\nTo keep our teams informed, we deployed \\ncomprehensive resources with up-to-date \\nCOVID-19 information, including a dedicated \\nplatform for teams returning to the office. \\nCOVID-19 case support, implemented for \\nall team members, included return-to-work \\nguidance and contact tracing, with the utmost \\nregard for employee privacy. We continue to \\noffer special sick leave for employees with \\npossible COVID-19 symptoms, as well as \\ncomprehensive health coverage.\\n\\nTo continue to manage our response going \\nforward, we created a dedicated pandemic \\nresponse team in 2022 in addition to the \\ncross-functional team that has been supporting \\nand guiding our COVID response.

We worked with \\nmobile carriers and school administrators \\nto deliver iPad devices with cellular support \\nfor students in need. With our Apple Card \\nCustomer Assistance Program, we also offered \\ncustomers the option to skip their monthly \\npayments without incurring interest. \\n\\nAcross many of our Apple Store locations, \\nwe were able to serve our customers’ \\nneeds through contactless pickup, express \\nstorefronts, and new online support. Our \\nresponse to COVID-19 is still ongoing, and \\nwe’re committed to implementing health \\nprotocols and adjusting store operations as \\nrequired based on available data and guidance \\nfrom health officials.\\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Supporting people in our supply chain\\nWe are continuing to work together with our \\nsuppliers to help them ensure that every \\nnecessary precaution is taken to keep people \\nsafe at work. In 2020, we introduced an \\nenhancement to our Code and Standards \\nspecifically addressing Infectious Disease \\nPreparedness and Response (IDPR). IDPR \\ncontains a set of new requirements resulting \\nfrom our learnings during the pandemic, which \\nwill help our suppliers better prepare for and \\nbe ready to respond to an infectious disease \\noutbreak at their facility. As part of the rollout \\nof IDPR in fiscal year 2021, we conducted \\nmore than 200 onsite and remote specialized \\nassessments to verify suppliers’ compliance \\nwith COVID-19 control protocols in order to \\ndrive improvement when necessary.\\n\\nWe also continue to assess any existing gaps \\nat supplier facilities, and identify opportunities \\nto work with those in higher-risk areas to \\nhelp make their facilities safer. This includes \\nworking with third-party suppliers to redesign \\nand reconfigure factory floor plans where \\nnecessary, implementing flexible working hours \\nto maximize interpersonal space, implementing \\nenhanced deep cleaning protocols, and \\ndeploying masks and sanitizers. In fiscal year \\n2021, we also encouraged our suppliers’ \\nemployees to get vaccinated and boosted \\nwhere available.\\n\\nWe also partnered with NGOs to help further \\nsupport supplier employees, as well as those \\nworking deeper in our supply chain, particularly \\nthose from vulnerable groups. We worked with \\nthe International Organization for Migration \\n(IOM) — the world’s leading organization \\nproviding services to migrant workers — to \\nprovide support to migrant workers impacted \\n\\nby the pandemic. With support from Apple, \\nour long-time partner Pact, an international \\ndevelopment organization, prepared and \\ncoordinated activities to prevent the spread of \\nCOVID-19 in several mining communities in the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The \\ninitiative has reached more than 50,000 people \\nthrough individual and group dialogues on \\nCOVID-19 prevention since the program began \\nin December 2020.\\n\\nGiving back to our communities\\nApple’s company-wide response to the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic involved teams across \\nthe business, including product design, \\nengineering, operations, packaging teams, \\nsuppliers, and more. At the beginning of the \\npandemic, when personal protective equipment \\nwas in short supply, we sourced through our \\nsupply chain and donated more than 30 million \\nmasks for healthcare workers worldwide. \\nWe also launched a company-wide effort to \\nproduce and ship over 10 million face shields. \\nThese face shields were delivered to sites \\naround the world, from New York Presbyterian \\nHospital in the U.S. to the Ministry of Health \\nin Zambia. \\n\\nAdditionally, we have also donated over \\n$10 million to the World Health Organization’s \\nCOVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. We also \\nmatched employee donations two-to-one to \\nsupport COVID-19 response efforts worldwide. \\nWe awarded $10 million from our Advanced \\nManufacturing Fund to COPAN diagnostics, \\na market leader in sample collection kits, \\nthat rapidly accelerated their ability to supply \\nsample collection kits to hospitals in the U.S. \\nfor COVID-19 testing. And our partnership \\nwith Product (RED) also supported COVID-19 \\nresponse (see page 65).\\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   32\\n\\nIn partnership with the White House \\nCoronavirus Task Force and the CDC, we \\nreleased an app and a website that guided \\nAmericans through a series of questions about \\ntheir health and exposure to determine if they \\nshould seek care for COVID-19 symptoms, \\nproviding CDC recommendations on next \\nsteps, including guidance on social distancing \\nand self-isolating, how to closely monitor \\n\\nsymptoms, recommendations on testing, \\nand when to contact a medical provider. \\nAnd we collaborated with Google to create a \\nnew exposure notification system for global \\ngovernments and health agencies, with user \\nprivacy and security central to its design, to \\nhelp fight the pandemic.\\n\\nCollaboration with our suppliers helps them make sure they’re taking every necessary \\nprecaution to keep people safe at work. \\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Health and safety at Apple \\n\\nWe’re dedicated to protecting our team \\nmembers and our customers everywhere \\nwe operate — a responsibility COVID-19 has \\nbrought into even greater focus. At every \\nstage of the pandemic, we’ve made decisions \\nbased on the latest local data and public health \\nguidance, and we share lessons across our \\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety (EHS) teams \\nglobally so we can continuously improve our \\nsafety programs. \\n\\nProtecting our people \\nWe’re always working hard to make sure our \\nworkers are safe no matter where they are \\nwhen they’re conducting business for Apple. \\nWe abide by EHS requirements in every country \\nwhere we operate and are dedicated to doing \\neverything we can to support the safety and \\nwell-being of our global teams. \\n\\nManaging work-related hazards and risks \\nTo help ensure the safety of our workers and \\ncustomers, we put procedures in place to \\nidentify workplace risks and mitigate possible \\nhazards. We support and protect employees \\nin lower hazard spaces, and we put risk-\\nspecific programs in place for those working \\nin higher hazard environments, including safe \\nsystems of work, chemical management, \\nlaser safety, equipment and machinery safety, \\nhazardous materials management, and \\nelectrical safety. Employees can request to \\nhave their workspaces individually inspected \\nto review hazards and controls, including \\nergonomics evaluations. \\n\\nApple implements a hierarchy of control \\nfor significant risks, which centers on \\nelimination, substitution, engineering controls, \\nadministrative controls, and personal protective \\nequipment (PPE).\\n\\nAs one example, Apple EHS regularly assesses \\nhazards at our research labs based on their \\nchemical, equipment, laser, and other hazards. \\nApproximately 9 percent of our labs are \\nconsidered “complex,” meaning that they \\ncontain high-hazard processes and equipment. \\nThese assessments help teams understand \\nwhich EHS programs and controls must be \\nput in place to mitigate risks. In 2021, Apple \\ncompleted hazard assessments in over 2500 \\nresearch labs globally.\\n\\nOur EHS teams identify and provide team \\nmembers with appropriate PPE for specific \\nhazards. This PPE is provided at no cost and \\nwith training on correct use. For example, \\nour hearing conservation programs include \\nevaluation and control of occupational \\nexposures to noise, and hearing protection is \\navailable for processes, areas, and tasks with \\npotential high noise exposures. Additionally, \\nEHS conducts mandatory health checks for \\nemployees where they’re needed.\\n\\nWe invest in new technologies as we continue \\nto manage potential risks across our operations, \\nincluding our Apple-owned manufacturing \\nsites. Our standards, programs, trainings, \\nprocedures, and other safeguards are managed \\nby trained EHS professionals, and where \\nrequired, we also translate EHS procedures into \\nlocal languages for our team members. \\n\\nRisks identified from incidents, injuries, and \\nnon-routine events are addressed expeditiously \\nto identify and implement appropriate \\ncorrective and preventative actions, and we \\nintegrate our learnings into future program \\ndevelopment and training. Lessons learned \\nare routinely communicated across Apple’s \\nEHS team and potentially affected operations, \\nand they are used to inform updates to existing \\npolicies and procedures.\\n\\nEmployees and managers can report incidents, \\nnear-misses, and observations — including \\nnewly identified hazards and risks—through \\nan internal iOS app. Incident responses are \\naddressed by Apple’s EHS team through a \\nconsistent process that connects employees \\nwith care and support, while identifying \\ncorrective actions where appropriate to prevent \\nfuture occurrences. \\n\\nWaste management\\nApple is committed to minimizing resource \\nuse and the associated generation of non-\\nhazardous or hazardous waste. Where \\npossible, Apple implements a waste hierarchy \\nof prevention, waste reduction at the source, \\nreuse of materials, recycling, energy recovery, \\nand landfilling as a last resort.\\n\\nWe maintain our commitment to the safe and \\nresponsible management of hazardous waste, \\nboth onsite and offsite. Any facility that does \\nnot meet our requirements is replaced by \\nanother approved waste management facility.\\n\\nWe made progress in 2021 at sites around \\nthe world:\\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   33\\n\\nU.S.: Thirteen of the Treatment, Storage, and \\nDisposal Facilities (TSDFs) we utilize in the U.S. \\nwere audited in 2021 to confirm that the waste \\nis treated, recycled, or incinerated within the \\ngoverning safety standards for health and the \\nenvironment. Eight disposal facility reviews \\nwere completed by vendors under Apple \\nmanagement, and we reviewed five other sites \\nvia third-party audit reports. At one of our major \\nresearch labs in Santa Clara Valley, the empty \\ncontainer management program resulted in a \\n3 percent reduction of lab debris for hazardous \\nwaste streams.\\n\\nUnited Kingdom: Through an internal initiative \\nto further strengthen waste management, \\nproduct site-specific waste initiatives \\nachieved a 97 percent diversion from landfill \\nand a 0.4 tonnes of waste/1002, both \\nexceeding requirements.\\n\\nIreland: The Cork Campus is ECVP 2799 Zero \\nWaste to Landfill Certified annually and has had \\nno material landfilled in the past five years.\\n\\nErgonomics\\nIn 2021, we continued to support our global \\nteam members working from home office, \\nApple office, and non-office settings. \\n\\nThe Apple ergonomics program is heavily \\nfocused on preventative measures to reduce \\nthe risk of work-related musculoskeletal \\ndisorders (WMSDs). This includes ergonomics \\ntraining sessions for our team members and \\nproviding input into the purchase or design \\nof work equipment, systems, and facilities to \\nensure that they meet ergonomic standards to \\nprovide the best levels of efficiency, comfort, \\nhealth, and safety for anyone using them. Our \\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ergonomics trainings and self-assessment \\nsupport are aimed at creating an awareness \\nof ergonomic risk factors for WMSDs, how to \\nprevent them, and how to proactively request \\nfor adjustments to workstations. \\n\\nWe completed over 10,000 individual support \\nrequests for our team members working from \\nhome, along with those who returned to Apple \\noffices and Apple Store locations. Support \\nincluded tailored guidance and feedback, \\nequipment recommendations, and 1:1 virtual \\nor in-person assessments. In addition, over \\n3000 employees participated in various \\ntraining sessions. \\n\\nOur industrial, warehouse, and other non-\\noffice operations teams were supported with \\napproximately 400 ergonomic risk assessments \\nand 76 lab screenings. The assessments \\nevaluated risk factors such as repetition, \\nforce, posture, and duration, while reviewing \\nthe interaction of the team member with \\nnew machines, equipment, work processes, \\nand workspaces.\\n\\nEmergency preparedness and response \\nBeyond COVID-19, we supported the response \\nto dozens of crisis events in 2021, including \\nfires, severe weather, and civil unrest. Our \\nresponses focused on the safety of our \\nemployees and business continuity. We \\nactivated 31 crisis management teams (CMTs) \\nto manage the most severe events, and 120 \\nadditional incidents were supported without \\nfull CMTs.\\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   34\\n\\nAll team members can sign up for Apple’s \\nEmergency Alert system, enabling them to be \\nnotified of local emergencies and to indicate \\nwhether they are safe or need help. Disaster \\nsupplies are available at our facilities. All Apple \\ncampuses with over 1000 employees have \\nFacility Response and Recovery Plans, which \\nprovide a comprehensive approach to the safety \\nand support of our employees while minimizing \\nbusiness interruption. Site-specific Emergency \\nResponse Plans have been implemented \\nglobally. These plans are communicated to all \\nemployees, and trainings and drills are held at \\nleast annually. And our employees are trained \\nin emergency response, allowing them to react \\nquickly while supporting the safety of our team \\nmembers and customers. \\n\\nIn 2021, we completed over 200 emergency \\nresponse drills, which were supported by \\n2700 trained Emergency Response Team \\n(ERT) members. We expect to increase the \\nfrequency of these drills, depending on \\nCOVID-19 restrictions. \\n\\nWith the care and support of our employees \\nand customers in mind, we deployed Automatic \\nExternal Defibrillator (AED) stations across \\nour global retail stores in 2021. And to ensure \\nthat our team members could effectively use \\nthis new tool, we provided AED training for our \\nteam members.\\n\\nAll campuses and key sites have disaster supplies \\nto match localized risks. As Apple’s footprint \\ngrows, sites are evaluated and supplies are \\nadded as needed. As one example, in 2021, we \\nlaunched earthquake preparedness campaigns \\nfor employees across the western United States \\nand Japan. We conducted outreach to provide \\nemployees with information, tools, and resources, \\nand we held drills in some offices.\\n\\nWe’re always working hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are when \\nthey’re conducting business for Apple. \\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Apple’s 2022 ESG Report   35\\n\\nOur EHS management systems are designed to provide a safe environment for teams \\nacross Apple.\\n\\nEHS management systems \\nTo provide a safe and sustainable environment \\nfor our teams, our EHS programs are built to \\nshare information about risks, requirements,  \\nand expectations for all workers.\\n\\nOur EHS policy outlines our commitment \\nto workplace safety and environmental \\nstewardship, and it establishes the principles \\nthat integrate effective EHS practices into all \\naspects of our business. The EHS policy is \\ncommunicated through mandatory training  \\nfor all new employees and through our  \\ninternal EHS website. \\n\\nApple’s EHS leadership team, including Apple’s \\nEHS director, is responsible for establishing \\npriorities, determining annual work plans, and \\nassigning resources to implement high-quality \\nservices in all geographies where we operate.\\n\\nCertifications\\nOur operations in Cork, Ireland, are certified \\nto ISO14001, an international standard for \\nenvironmental management systems.

However, when \\ncombined with regular engagement with \\nsupplier teams, mandated reporting, and \\nlistening directly to hundreds of thousands \\nof supplier employees about their workplace \\nexperiences, our rigorous supplier assessments \\nprovide a clear measure of their performance in \\nupholding our Code and Standards.\\n\\nIn the 2021 reporting period, 1177 assessments \\nwere conducted in 52 countries. This included \\n886 Code of Conduct assessments and 291 \\nsmelter and refiner assessments.20 Since 2007, \\nApple-managed assessments have covered \\n94 percent of our direct manufacturing spend. \\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Apple’s 2022 ESG Report   39\\n\\nA responsibility that  \\ngrows with our business\\nAs Apple’s business continues to grow and \\nexpand to new areas, we adapt our supplier \\nengagement model accordingly. This includes \\ncontinuing to expand our scope to conduct \\nindependent, third-party assessments of a \\ngrowing number of suppliers that support \\nour business outside of manufacturing. Last \\nyear, we increased our engagement and \\nexpanded the application of our Code and \\nStandards to suppliers supporting newer areas \\nof Apple’s business, including those that work \\nwith our content services like Apple TV+ and \\nApple\\xa0Fitness+.\\n\\nHow we stay engaged with suppliers\\n\\nCode of conduct  \\n\\nassessments\\n\\nEarly  \\nengagement\\n\\nOngoing  \\ntraining\\n\\nSpecialized  \\nassessments\\n\\nInvestigations\\n\\nCapability building\\n\\nbeen taken to prevent a reoccurrence. We \\nprohibit retaliation of any kind against supplier \\nemployees who participate in our assessments.\\n\\nOur goal is to work together with suppliers to \\nhelp them improve their management systems, \\nrather than to simply remove them from our \\nsupply chain without helping them correct the \\nissues we have discovered. In the event that a \\nsupplier is unwilling or unable to improve their \\noperations to meet our requirements, they risk \\nremoval from our supply chain. Since 2009, we \\nhave directed the removal of 24 manufacturing \\nsupplier facilities and 170 smelters and refiners \\nfrom our supply chain for being unwilling or \\nunable to sufficiently improve their operations \\nto meet our requirements.\\n\\nResults of our assessments are detailed in our \\nPeople and Environment in Our Supply Chain \\nReport beginning on page 91. \\n\\nThese assessments also include unannounced \\nassessments and unannounced visits \\nin response to workers’ grievances and \\nallegations, or to verify risks at supplier facilities \\nbased on predictive analytics. In fiscal year \\n2021, 211 unannounced assessments and \\ninvestigations were conducted where the \\nsupplier facility was provided no advance notice \\nof our arrival. This is nearly double the number \\nconducted in 2020.\\n\\nIn addition to third-party Code of Conduct \\nassessments, we require many of our suppliers \\nto also undergo the Responsible Business \\nAlliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program \\n(VAP), a facility-wide, third-party assessment \\n\\nwidely used by the industry. A total of 99 RBA \\nVAP assessments were completed in fiscal year \\n2021 at Apple supplier sites.\\n\\nIf we uncover non-compliance in the course \\nof any assessment or engagement, we take \\nprompt action so that suppliers not only correct \\nand remedy the issue, but make meaningful, \\nlong-term changes to their systems and \\nprocesses. We do this through a Corrective \\nAction Plan (CAP), during which 30-, 60-, and \\n90-day check-ins with Apple are required.  \\nWe then conduct our Corrective Action \\nVerification (CAV) process to verify that all \\ncorrective actions have been successfully \\nimplemented, and necessary steps have \\n\\nSupplier employees at Final Assembly in the U.S.\\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Partnerships that accelerate progress\\nWe are collaborating with industry associations, \\ncivil society organizations, and multi-\\nstakeholder initiatives around the world to \\npromote best practices, to listen to and learn \\nfrom others’ perspectives and experiences, and \\nto scale innovative solutions, helping everyone \\nto achieve progress at a more rapid pace. See \\npage 32 of the People and Environment in Our \\nSupply Chain Report for more detail on the \\norganizations we work with.\\n\\nLabor and human rights  \\nin the supply chain \\n\\nPeople come first in everything we do. Our \\ncommitment to protecting the people in our \\nsupply chain has been unwavering, anchored \\nby a simple set of beliefs: People deserve to be \\ntreated with dignity and to know their rights. \\nThey should be able to speak up if those rights \\nare not being respected — and to know and \\nexpect that when they do, we will listen and act. \\n\\nWe’re committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain.\\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   40\\n\\nWe are committed to respecting the rights of \\nevery individual in our supply chain — just like \\nwe do for our team members, customers, and \\nother partners — and more broadly, to working \\nwith others to share our tools and the lessons \\nwe’ve learned, and to empowering everyone to \\nachieve progress more rapidly.\\n\\nListening to workers\\nEffective grievance channels, ongoing worker \\nmanagement communications, and supplier \\nemployee feedback are essential to ensuring \\nrespect for worker rights and maintaining \\nsafe and healthy workplaces. Whether \\nthrough social dialogue and formal employee \\nrepresentation, workplace satisfaction \\nsurveys, anonymous hotlines, focus groups, \\nor interviews during annual assessments, the \\nfeedback we receive directly from supplier \\nemployees helps us ensure labor and human \\nrights are respected throughout our global \\nsupply chain. We also use this feedback \\nto address emerging risks, improve rights \\ntraining for supplier employees and supplier \\nmanagement, and to continually strengthen our \\nCode and Standards.\\n\\n•  Rights awareness: We believe that \\n\\nprotection starts with rights awareness, \\nand since 2008, more than 23.6 million \\nsupplier employees have been trained on \\ntheir workplace rights. Under our Code and \\nStandards, suppliers are required to provide \\nemployees with training on their workplace \\nrights. This training is generally conducted \\nduring new employee orientation, and \\ncovers international labor standards, local \\nlabor laws, environmental health and safety, \\nand the protections required by our Code \\nand Standards\\n\\n•  Feedback channels: Supplier employee \\ninterviews are an important part of every \\nassessment conducted. Each year, we \\ninterview tens of thousands of supplier \\nemployees in their local language and \\nwithout their managers present, to determine \\nwhether or not their experience on the job \\naligns with auditors’ observations during \\nassessments. In fiscal year 2021, despite \\nthe ongoing challenges presented by \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, we interviewed \\n87,626 workers in our supply chain — over \\n35,000 more than were interviewed in the \\nprevious fiscal year. \\n\\n  Our Code and Standards require effective \\n\\n \\n\\nworker feedback channels, including \\ngrievance mechanisms, at all supplier sites. \\nWe also provide third-party anonymous \\nhotlines, which are also available to our \\nemployees (see page 72), and the ability to \\ncontact the Apple Environment and Supply \\nChain Innovation (ESCI) team directly at any \\ntime and in any language. When an issue is \\nraised, we require supplier management to \\nimmediately investigate and to resolve the \\nissue in a timely manner.\\nIn 2021, we launched a grievance hotline \\nawareness campaign, and its initial rollout \\nresulted in a 22 percent increase in utilization \\nof these third-party hotlines. The reports \\nwe received from supplier employees via \\nhotlines in 2021 included issues related to \\nwages and benefits, employee relations, \\namenities at supplier facilities, workforce \\nstability, and health and safety. In each case, \\nwe investigated and worked directly with the \\nsuppliers to drive improvement and correct \\nany compliance issues found.

In 2021, we anonymously \\nsurveyed 264,963 supplier employees in \\n191 facilities across Greater China, India, \\nIreland, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, \\nUK, U.S., and Vietnam about their workplace \\nexperiences — nearly double the number of \\nsupplier employees surveyed last fiscal year. \\nAs a result, suppliers took 3944 actions, \\nincluding better commute options, increasing \\nwages and bonuses, offering better food \\nvariety, and skill development opportunities \\nfor entry-level managers.\\n\\nResponsible labor recruitment\\nOur Code and Standards, and the protections \\nthey provide, apply equally to all workers, \\nregardless of a person’s job, geographic \\nlocation, or how they enter our supply chain \\n— and this commitment begins even before \\na worker ever enters our supply chain. This \\nincludes zero tolerance for forced labor. \\n\\nWe implement strict policies and procedures \\nwith our suppliers to protect workers in our \\nsupply chain from forced labor. This includes \\nselecting suppliers for assessments based \\non factors, such as their geographic location, \\nwhich may put them at higher risk of forced \\nlabor violations, as well as their previous \\nperformance and/or history of violations or \\nallegations. Suppliers may also receive additional \\nspecialized assessments based on the nature \\nof their business or employee population, such \\nas those that employ Foreign Contract Workers, \\nand those located in higher risk migration \\ncorridors. Our Code and Standards also require \\nthat all supplier employees have an effective \\nmechanism to report grievances. In addition, \\nwe provide third-party anonymous hotlines and \\nthe ability to contact the Apple Environment and \\nSupply Chain Innovation (ESCI) team directly at \\nany time and in any language. When an issue \\nis raised, supplier management is required to \\npromptly investigate and to resolve the issue in a \\ntimely manner.\\n\\nWe strictly prohibit any form of involuntary labor \\nthroughout our worldwide supply chain and look \\nfor evidence of it in every supplier assessment \\nwe conduct, including unannounced \\nassessments. Last year, we conducted more \\nthan 1100 assessments, and found no instances \\nwhere anyone was forced to work in our \\nsupply chain. \\n\\nWe did discover two cases in Taiwan in which \\npeople paid recruitment fees to secure their \\njob, which is a violation of our Code. We \\nrequired the supplier to directly repay their \\nemployees in full, and verified repayment \\nthrough a third-party auditor. The payment of \\nrecruitment fees, withholding an employee’s \\npassport or personal identity documents, \\nor restricting an employee’s freedom of \\nmovement are Core Violations of our Code \\nand Standards — the most serious level of \\nCode violations. If we discover workers have \\npaid recruitment fees at any point on their \\nemployment journey to an Apple supplier, we \\nrequire supplier management to take prompt \\naction to provide remedy to those affected \\nby directly repaying their workers for any and \\nall fees, even if the supplier was unaware \\nthat their employees had paid recruitment \\nfees. From 2008 through fiscal year 2021, \\nour suppliers have repaid $33.2 million in \\nrecruitment fees directly to 37,322 workers.\\n\\nFinally, in collaboration with the International \\nOrganization for Migration (IOM) and the \\nResponsible Business Alliance (RBA), we \\nexpanded our Responsible Labor Recruitment \\nToolkit to more than 39 additional supplier \\nfacilities in 10 countries, reaching nearly 77,000 \\nworkers globally, with 66 percent of those \\nworking on Apple production lines.\\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Introduction \\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\nOur People\\n\\nSuppliers Customers\\n\\nCommunities\\n\\nGovernance\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   42\\n\\nHow we  \\nwork to \\nprevent forced \\nlabor in our \\nsupply chain\\n\\nApple has zero tolerance for forced \\nlabor. In the more than 50 countries \\nand regions where our suppliers \\noperate, we have teams of experts, \\nincluding independent third parties, \\nwho monitor our suppliers and put in \\nplace industry-leading procedures \\nto help ensure that no one is forced \\nto work.

Our \\nstandards often go above and beyond legal \\nrequirements to protect people from forced \\nlabor risks.\\n\\n  Aligning with international frameworks.\\n\\n Apple policies and our supplier requirements align with \\ninternational labor and human rights standards, including those \\nof the International Labour Organization, the United Nations \\nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), and \\nthe Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development.\\n\\n  The Apple Human Rights Policy\\n\\n Our Human Rights Policy outlines how we treat everyone, \\nincluding our customers, employees, business partners,  \\nand the people across every level of our supply chain. \\nRead the Apple Human Rights Policy\\n\\n \\n\\n The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier \\nResponsibility Standards\\n Our supplier requirements contain strict standards for \\nresponsible labor recruitment, and apply to all suppliers, \\nprotecting workers globally. We go above and beyond legal \\nrequirements in many places by strictly prohibiting labor \\nrecruitment in regions where we cannot conduct adequate  \\ndue diligence and by maintaining a zero recruitment fees policy, \\nbecause we believe no one should pay to secure a job. \\n Read the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct \\nand Supplier Responsibility Standards\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n To address forced labor risks at its roots,  \\nwe know that our work has to begin before \\npeople enter our supply chain.\\n\\n  Thorough mapping informs our strategy.\\n\\n An effective strategy requires deep understanding of our \\nsupply chain. To date, we have mapped over 1000 labor \\nrecruitment agencies that work with our suppliers across \\n32\\xa0countries.\\n\\n  A leading strategy requires leading tools.\\n\\n The Apple Responsible Labor Recruitment Toolkit, developed \\nin partnership with the International Organization for \\nMigration, provides suppliers and their labor agencies with \\neasy-to-use tools that help them effectively manage and \\nreport data, mitigating forced labor risks before people even \\nenter our supply chain. In addition to providing hands-on \\ntraining, we are making these tools openly available for others \\nto use.\\n\\n  Awareness is power.\\n\\n We require our suppliers to provide their employees with \\ntraining on their workplace rights on their first day on the \\njob. This helps to ensure that every person is aware of \\ntheir rights and what to do if they’re not being respected, \\nwhich includes the ability to anonymously contact Apple \\ndirectly. Foreign Contract Workers, who make up a very \\nsmall percentage of people in our supply chain, also receive \\ntraining prior to leaving their home country, as well as upon \\narriving in their destination country. To date, our suppliers \\nhave provided workplace rights training to over 23.6 million \\npeople. In addition, last year we directly engaged with over \\n350,000 people in our supply chain to learn more about their \\nworkplace experience. \\n\\n \\n\\nInvesting in consistent improvement.\\n Through our new Supplier Employee Development Fund, \\nwe’re investing $50M to expand programs designed \\nto continue to improve the rights training experience, \\nworker voice platforms, and supplier employee education \\nopportunities.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n3   We hold suppliers accountable.\\n Once we’ve implemented thorough \\npreventative measures, independent, \\nthird-party assessments verify that our \\nsuppliers are meeting our standards. \\nLooking for evidence of forced labor is part \\nof every supplier assessment. If we find any \\nviolations of our Code and Standards, we \\ntake swift action to remedy the issue and \\nimprove their operations.\\n\\n  A close look.\\n\\n We regularly conduct independent, third-party assessments, \\nincluding surprise assessments, of our suppliers, verifying \\ncompliance with over 500 points across our standards. This \\nincludes an extensive document review to be sure all hiring \\nand personnel records are in place and accurate. In addition \\nto specialized forced labor assessments for at-risk suppliers, \\nwe also require many suppliers to participate in facility-wide \\nassessments, such as the Validated Assessment Program, \\nto verify performance across the supplier’s entire business. \\nIn the event that we find gaps in a supplier’s compliance \\nor capabilities, we require them to implement a Corrective \\nAction Plan. To date, our assessments have covered 94 \\npercent of our direct manufacturing spend. \\n\\n  We investigate every report.\\n\\n In addition to thoroughly assessing our suppliers’ performance \\nin upholding our standards, we also receive reports from the \\npress, governments, civil society, and people in our supply \\nchain, and we encourage the public to report concerns via \\nhttps://www.apple.com/uk/supplier-responsibility/. We \\ninvestigate every report, and frequently have Apple teams \\nonsite within 24 hours.\\n\\n  Swift action and steep penalties.\\n\\n Forced labor in any form is a Core Violation (the most serious \\nviolation level) of our requirements. If a Core Violation is \\ndiscovered, the supplier’s CEO is notified and the supplier \\nis immediately placed on probation, pending the successful \\ncompletion of a Corrective Action Plan. Probation can include \\nno new projects, no new business, and termination of existing \\nbusiness. In addition to commercial penalties, if a supplier is \\nunable or unwilling to meet our standards, they risk removal \\nfrom our supply chain. Since 2009, we have directed the \\nremoval of 24 manufacturing supplier facilities and 170 \\nsmelters and refiners for failure to meet our requirements.\\n\\n  Action this year.\\n\\n In FY21, across more than 1100 assessments, we found \\nno instances where anyone was forced to work in our \\nsupply chain. We did find two cases where employees of \\nthe same supplier in Taiwan paid recruitment fees. Per our \\nrequirements, the supplier directly repaid their employees for \\nthose fees. To date, our suppliers have directly repaid $33.2M \\nin recruitment fees to 37,322 of their employees.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n4  \\n\\n We track progress  \\nand report transparently.\\n Consistent improvement requires \\ntransparency and accountability.

When contracting with suppliers, we use our \\npurchasing power to increase diversity in our supply chain and change outdated \\nnorms that hurt those who are underrepresented in their field or industry. \\n\\nApple’s award-winning Supplier Diversity program, established in 1993, actively \\nengages suppliers from historically underrepresented communities. \\n\\nWe have policies and procedures that require diverse supplier participation during \\nearly-stage sourcing, key performance indicators to measure company success, \\nand diversity awareness trainings for our global sourcing team members and related \\nApple business units. \\n\\nIn 2016, Apple was the first Silicon Valley–based company to be invited  \\ninto the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR) in recognition of our long-standing  \\ncommitment to promoting diversity within our supplier base. BDR celebrates \\ncorporations that achieved spending of at least $1 billion with minority- and  \\nwoman-owned businesses. \\n\\nIn calendar year 2021, Apple spent over $7.1 billion with diverse suppliers around the \\nworld. Our Supplier Diversity program offers support to participating suppliers and \\nseeks active engagement in industry diversity leadership activities. For example, \\nsupplier development has been a long-standing commitment within Apple’s supply \\nchain, which is facilitated internally and externally.

And in \\n2021, we expanded the accessibility options for \\nMemoji to include cochlear implants, an oxygen \\ntube, and a soft helmet.\\n\\nInclusive design\\n\\nBuilding on our accessibility work, we’ve \\nalways believed that in order to create the most \\npersonal technology in the world, we must \\nconsider the full range of human experiences. \\nAll across Apple there is a sustained \\ncommitment to making products more inclusive \\nfor a wide range of diverse groups. Apple \\n\\nengineers work hand in hand with teams across \\nthe business to help solve unique problems \\nothers seldom think about. \\n\\nFor example, with iOS 14.5, Siri no longer has a \\ndefault voice, allowing users to choose the voice \\nthat speaks to them when they first set up their \\ndevice, and in English, users can now select \\nmore diverse voice options. We’re also taking \\nsteps to ensure equity in our cameras’ automatic \\nperson recognition features so that everyone \\ncan have the same extraordinary experience, \\nno matter the photographic subject’s skin color, \\nage, or gender. As a result, the machine learning \\nmodels used in camera technology must show \\nsimilar performance across various age groups, \\ngenders, ethnicities, skin tones, and other \\nattributes. We’ve also published research  \\non this work to help others learn from it.\\n\\nBeyond our own products and services, \\nwe’ve developed machine learning research \\nand Human Interface Guidelines to support \\ndevelopers in building inclusive apps that \\nput people first by prioritizing respectful \\ncommunication and presenting content and \\nfunctionality in ways that everyone can access \\nand understand. Some of the characteristics \\nto consider include age, gender and gender \\nidentity, race and ethnicity, language and culture, \\nand social and economic context, among \\nothers. We also provide tools, documentation, \\nsample code, and design best practices to help \\ndevelopers make their apps more accessible. \\n\\nWe launched two videos during our Worldwide \\nDevelopers Conference (WWDC) in June \\n2021 on the process and practice of inclusive \\ndesign that were among the most popular of the \\nweek: The Process of Inclusive Design and The \\nPractice of Inclusive Design.\\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Education\\n\\nFor more than 40 years, we’ve worked \\nalongside educators to inspire the next \\ngeneration of learners, supporting creativity, \\nproblem-solving, communication, and \\ncollaboration.

In fiscal year 2017, we started calculating scope 3 emissions not listed in \\nthis table. In fiscal year 2021, these include electricity transmission and \\ndistribution losses amounted to about 28,000 metric tons CO2e and life \\ncycle emissions associated with renewable energy amounted to about \\n95,000 metric tons CO2e. We have not accounted for emissions resulting \\nfrom employees working from home, because we anticipated these \\nemissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving \\nour methodology. \\n\\n5.  We regularly revisit our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability \\n\\nstandards. So in fiscal year 2018, we changed how we calculate emissions \\nfrom business travel in order to better account for classes of service in air \\ntravel. As a result of this change, our scope 3 transportation emissions \\nincreased by 77 percent between 2017 and 2018. Without the methodology \\nchange, these emissions would have increased by 14 percent, which reflects \\nthe growth in our business.\\n\\n6.  Beginning in fiscal year 2020, we updated our methodology to reflect the \\n\\nimpact of COVID-19 on employee commute.\\n\\n7.  We retired 167,000 metric tons of carbon credits from the Chyulu Hills project \\n\\nin Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal \\nyear 2021. This project is certified to the VCS and CCB standards.\\n\\n8.  Because we’re committed to accuracy and transparency, we regularly refine \\nour product life cycle assessment model and sources of data. For example, \\nwe recently obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our \\nproducts are sold and used, resulting in more granularity possible for grid \\nemission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase. The  \\nnet result was an increase in our 2021 carbon footprint. When using the \\nsame level of data granularity and model as 2021, our product use carbon \\nemissions in 2021 would have been about 2.5 percent lower.\\n\\n9.  For fiscal year 2021, we retired credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya, \\n\\nand purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total \\nof 500,000 metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain. The first \\nproject, a REDD+ coastal conservation project in Guatemala, protects and \\nconserves forests from deforestation and degradation. The second project \\naims to establish forests on about 46,000 hectares of barren land that is not \\notherwise in use across seven counties in the Guizhou Province of China. \\nBoth projects are certified to the same high standards that we require for \\nprojects in the Restore Fund, including VCS and CCBS. These projects are all \\ncertified to the VCS and CCB standards.\\n\\n10. Due to rounding, our gross and net carbon footprints do not always the sum \\n\\nof the subtotals disclosed above. \\n\\n Notes: For data on previous years, please reference past Environmental Progress \\nReports, available at apple.com/environment.

Beginning in FY2021, we’re accounting for the purchase of district heating, \\n\\nchilled water, and steam.\\n\\n2.    Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency \\n\\nsavings are calculated cumulatively since 2012. All efficiency measures \\nare retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented by the \\nCalifornia Energy Commission. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, corporate \\nfacilities energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climate \\ncontrols due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy. These savings are not \\nincluded in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives. \\nWe also recognize that energy use at our employees’ homes likely increased \\nduring this period. We have not accounted for this energy use, because we \\nanticipated this impact is small relative to our overall energy use and we are \\nstill evolving our methodology. \\n\\n3.    Energy savings from supplier energy efficiency improvements are reported \\nas annualized annual numbers. Prior to 2020, supplier energy savings are \\ncalculated on a calendar year basis. Beginning in 2020, supplier energy \\nsavings are calculated based on the fiscal year. \\n\\n4.

Other \\nalternative sources of freshwater include rainwater \\nand recovered condensate that is captured onsite. \\nWater used for construction for activities like dust \\ncontrol is not included in this total, and represents \\n13 million gallons of water used in fiscal year 2021. \\nOur actual water discharge may vary by 10 percent \\nrelative to our estimates. In these estimates, we’ve \\ntaken into account consumptive activities including \\nirrigation and cooling towers.\\n\\n14  These sites have been third-party verified by UL \\nLLC against the UL 2799 Standard.

It’s why we work every \\nday to make our technology an even greater force for good.\\n\\nToday, our teams around the world infuse Apple’s deeply held values into everything we make. That work can \\ntake many forms. But whether we’re protecting the right to privacy, designing technology that is accessible to \\nall, or using more recycled material in our products than ever, we are always working to make a difference for \\nthe people we serve and the planet we inhabit.\\n\\nAs a company, we know that our impact on people’s lives reaches beyond the technology we create.

We work  \\nwith teachers, advocates, and entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds as part of our Racial Equity and Justice \\nInitiative. We help create opportunity in communities on the frontlines of climate change through the Restore \\nFund, which supports carbon removal and sustainable forestry. And we provide resources and training to \\nthe next generation of innovators through the Apple Developer Academy and educational initiatives across \\nthe globe. \\n\\nIn this report, we are pleased to share our progress, which is a product of collaboration with committed \\npartners worldwide. At Apple, we believe that the only way to effectively tackle global challenges is by  \\nworking together, and we are grateful to share this road with so many passionate leaders.\\n\\nWe’re engaged in this work because it’s right — and because we want to leave the world better than we  \\nfound it in everything we do.

And at \\nthe 26th UN Climate Change Conference of \\nthe Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, \\nin 2021, Apple called for bold government \\naction on climate change, joining several new \\ninitiatives, including the First Movers Coalition, \\nthe Forest Investor Club, and the Clean Energy \\nDemand Initiative.\\n\\nWe also advocate for country-specific measures \\nthat motivate climate action. For example, \\nwe’ve called for enhanced climate ambition \\nand renewable energy deployment in Japan’s \\nBasic Energy Plan and Nationally Determined \\nContribution (Japan’s plan to reduce emissions \\nin furtherance of the Paris Agreement), and for \\n\\nApple’s Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, Lisa Jackson, alongside President Joe Biden \\nand other leaders from around the world at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference.

As \\njust one recent example, we’ve continued \\nour public support for LGBTQ+ equality by \\nworking with The Human Rights Campaign \\nand other organizations to support LGBTQ+ \\nequality protections and oppose discriminatory \\nproposals. This includes legislative advocacy \\nat the federal and state levels, and working \\nwith coalitions of businesses to stand against \\nwhat we believe to be harmful and divisive \\nlegislation that threatens individuals, families, \\nand communities. Most recently, that included \\nsending a letter to Texas leadership opposing \\nlaws that discriminate against the LGBTQ+ \\ncommunity. Read more here. \\n\\nProtecting our customers\\nIn the U.S., the legal system is one avenue \\nthrough which Apple can take action to support \\nour values. For example, in January 2022, \\nApple, along with other leading companies, \\nfiled an amicus brief in support of the EPA’s \\nauthority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions \\nbecause that authority “is critical to combatting \\nclimate change.”\\n\\nIn November 2021, Apple filed a lawsuit against \\nNSO Group and its parent company to hold it \\naccountable for the surveillance and targeting \\nof Apple users. The complaint provides new \\ninformation on how NSO Group infected victims’ \\ndevices with its Pegasus spyware. To prevent \\nfurther abuse and harm to its users, Apple is \\nseeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO \\nGroup from using any Apple software, services, \\nor devices. \\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Our commitment to human rights\\n\\nOur commitment begins with \\ntreating everyone with dignity \\nand respect.

We believe in the power \\nof technology to empower and \\nconnect people around the world \\n— and that business can and \\nshould be a force for good.\\n\\nEmbedding respect for human rights\\nWe’ve worked to embed respect for human \\nrights across our company — in the technology \\nwe make, the way we make it, and how we treat \\npeople. A number of teams are responsible \\nfor carrying out human rights due diligence, \\nincluding the Privacy, Corporate, and \\nCompliance teams within Apple’s Legal and \\nGlobal Security organization, as well as Apple’s \\nEnvironment and Supply Chain Innovation (ESCI) \\nteam within Worldwide Operations.\\n\\nOur commitment to civil rights\\nWe are deeply committed to building a more \\njust and inclusive world and are moving forward \\nwith plans to conduct a civil rights audit.\\n\\nApple’s Human Rights Policy\\nOur Human Rights Policy governs how we treat \\neveryone, including our customers, employees, \\nbusiness partners, and people across our \\nsupply chain. We’re deeply committed to \\nrespecting internationally recognized human \\nrights in our business operations, as set out \\nin the United Nations (UN) International Bill of \\nHuman Rights and the International Labour \\nOrganization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental \\nPrinciples and Rights at Work. Our approach is \\nbased on the UN Guiding Principles on Business \\nand Human Rights (UNGPs).\\n\\nWe conduct human rights due diligence to \\nidentify risks and work to mitigate them. We \\nalso seek to remedy adverse impacts, track \\nand measure our progress, and report our \\nfindings. Our board of directors adopted the \\npolicy and is responsible for overseeing and \\nperiodically reviewing it. Apple’s Senior Vice \\nPresident and General Counsel is responsible \\nfor its implementation, and reports to the \\nBoard and its committees on our progress and \\nsignificant issues.\\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   10\\n\\nIdentifying and managing  \\nsalient human rights risks\\nIdentifying human rights risks is the first step  \\nto addressing those risks through improvements \\nto our policies and management systems. We \\nwork to align our efforts with the business and \\nhuman rights due diligence process set forth  \\nin the UNGPs to identify, mitigate, prevent,  \\nand remedy human rights risks. \\n\\nWe identify salient human rights risks through \\ninternal risk assessments and external industry-\\nlevel third-party audits, as well as through the \\nchannels we maintain with rights holders and \\nother stakeholders, including investors, human \\nrights and labor experts, governments, and \\ninternational bodies such as the UN.\\n\\nIn addition to our own internal monitoring,  \\nwe consider reports identifying potential risks \\nfrom external sources, including international \\norganizations, policy makers, shareholders, civil \\nsociety organizations, news outlets, customers, \\nindividuals in the supply chain or supply chain \\ncommunities, whistleblower mechanisms, \\nand third-party hotlines.

In 2021, we \\ncontinued to improve the carbon efficiency of \\nthe integrated circuits we use in our products \\n— components we’ve prioritized because they \\nare carbon-intensive. For example, switching \\nto the Apple M1 chip for the 13-inch MacBook \\nPro reduced the energy needed to manufacture \\nand use the device, driving down the product’s \\ncarbon footprint by over 8 percent.\\n\\nWe’ve continued to expand our use of \\n100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures \\nof a number of products. All iPad models in our \\nlineup now use 100 percent recycled aluminum \\nin their enclosures — joining Apple Watch \\nSeries 7, Apple Watch SE, MacBook Air, Mac \\nmini, and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro \\ndevices.

These \\nchanges alone have decreased the carbon \\nemissions associated with our use of aluminum \\nby 68 percent since 2015.\\n\\nProduct energy use accounts for 22 percent  \\nof our gross carbon footprint — and has an \\nimpact on the individual energy use of each  \\nof our customers. By addressing this in the \\nearliest phases of design, we’ve cut the product \\nenergy use across all major product lines by \\nmore than 70 percent since 2008 through \\nenergy efficiency improvements.3 In fiscal \\nyear 2021, over 99 percent of Apple’s eligible \\nproducts, by revenue, received an ENERGY \\nSTAR rating for superior energy efficiency.4  \\nAnd over 99 percent of Apple’s eligible \\nproducts, by revenue, met the requirements  \\nfor EPEAT registration.5\\n\\nEnergy efficiency\\nWe’re focused on using less energy across \\nour operations, beginning with how we design, \\noperate, and maintain our facilities. And we \\ncontinue these same efforts into our supply \\nchain, which benefits the communities where \\nour suppliers operate. Drawing less energy from \\nelectrical grids — many of which still rely heavily \\non fossil fuels — helps reduce local air pollution \\nand improve air quality for nearby communities.\\n\\nThe emissions from manufacturing our products \\naccount for about 70 percent of Apple’s gross \\ncarbon footprint. We launched our Supplier Energy \\nEfficiency Program in 2015 with the goal of helping \\nsuppliers optimize their facilities and operations \\nto use as little energy as possible. We provide \\nguidance designed to help suppliers uncover \\nopportunities for energy efficiency.

Initiatives that \\nwe’ve been growing for years — like sourcing 100 percent \\nrenewable electricity for our facilities, transitioning suppliers \\nto clean energy, and using low-carbon materials in products \\n— yielded indisputable results. \\n\\nThanks to this work, we’ve begun to decouple business \\ngrowth from emissions: While our revenue grew 33 percent, \\nour emissions grew by less than 5 percent. To mitigate this \\nincrease in emissions, we applied an additional 0.6 million \\ntons of renewable energy credits (RECs) and 0.5 million \\nmetric tons of carbon offsets to proportionally cover \\nelectricity use and direct emissions, respectively, across our \\nvalue chain.

We’ve focused our \\nefforts to source renewables around several \\nkey pillars: creating new renewable energy \\nprojects, undertaking projects that deliver clear \\nbenefits to local communities, and supporting \\nrenewable energy innovations. About 1.5 \\ngigawatts of Apple-created renewable \\nelectricity projects account for over 90 percent \\nof the renewable electricity our facilities use.\\n\\nDirect emissions abatement\\nTo address the non-electricity emissions \\nassociated with our materials and \\nmanufacturing processes, we seek \\ntechnological solutions through emissions \\nabatement or switching to low-carbon fuel \\noptions. For example, we partnered with \\naluminum companies and the governments \\nof Canada and Quebec to help fund research \\nand development for ELYSIS, a technology that \\neliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions \\nfrom aluminum smelting.\\n\\nWe continue to experience tremendous \\nprogress toward our goal of transitioning our \\nmanufacturing supply chain to 100 percent \\nrenewable electricity by 2030. As of March \\n2022, 213 manufacturing partners in 25 \\ncountries have committed to 100 percent \\nrenewable energy for Apple production.\\n\\nOver 70 percent of companies on Apple’s \\nSupplier List — those suppliers that make \\nup 98 percent of Apple’s direct spend for \\nmaterials, manufacturing, and assembly of \\nour products worldwide — have committed to \\n100 percent renewable electricity. In addition, \\nmany other smaller suppliers have also made \\nthese commitments.\\n\\nMany components essential to products like \\nours, including integrated circuit chips and \\ndisplay panels, currently rely on manufacturing \\nprocesses that use fluorinated gases, which \\nhave high global warming potential. We’re \\npartnering closely with key manufacturers \\nto prevent these gases from being \\nreleased into the atmosphere by optimizing \\nmanufacturing processes and deploying \\nabatement technologies.\\n\\nTo address emissions from shipping products \\nto our customers, we’re shifting whenever \\npossible toward less carbon-intensive shipping \\nmodes, such as rail and ocean. And we’re \\nseeking out technical innovations, including \\nalternative fuels and electric vehicles. In fiscal \\nyear 2021, Apple avoided 180,000 metric tons \\nof CO2e by shifting the mode of transport and \\nreducing product weight through the removal  \\nof the power adapter from the box of \\niPhone devices. \\n\\nProviding access to clean energy in South Africa \\nEven a few years ago, not everyone in one community in South Africa had electricity  \\nat home. Many people had been using battery-powered lanterns because upfront costs \\nand other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach. As we worked with our \\npartners to identify new renewable energy projects for our Power for Impact program,  \\nwe saw exciting potential in this community. \\n\\nOur partner on the ground, DC GO, a solar energy provider based in Johannesburg,  \\ngot to work meeting members of the community and learning more about their needs. \\nUltimately, DC GO developed a pay-as-you-go model that brought solar energy to 3500 \\nhomes that previously lacked access. This was possible only because of the way they  \\nbuilt relationships with community members and worked with Apple to price the solution  \\nin line with what people were already spending on batteries for their lanterns.\\n\\nIn addition, DC GO hired and trained local people for jobs in sales, maintenance,  \\nand other roles that not only created local jobs but also helped to make sure the project \\n — and the community’s access to electricity — would be sustainable over time.  \\nThis is just one example of how the Power for Impact program is working to benefit \\ncommunities, our company, and the environment at the same time.

To align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures \\n(TCFD) recommendations, we considered a range of future scenarios, including a scenario below 2°C. \\nAnd we assessed geographies around the world to capture both corporate and supplier activities. The \\nanalysis highlighted how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals could contribute to our \\ncorporate resiliency. It also provided environmental data that we considered in developing business strategies, \\nincluding considerations around supply chain diversification, as well as safeguarding our global assets.\\n\\nWe’re committed to managing regulatory, reputational, and market risks related to climate change.  \\nFor more information on these climate-related risks and Apple’s governance of these risks, read our  \\n2021 CDP submission (PDF).\\n\\nCarbon removal\\nTo address the emissions we can’t yet avoid, \\nwe’re are investing in carbon removal projects. \\nIn addition to removing carbon, nature-based \\ncarbon removal projects also offer important \\necological and social benefits, such as preserving \\nbiodiversity and enhancing the resilience of \\necosystems, while often providing economic \\ndevelopment opportunities for local communities.\\n\\nWe partnered with Conservation International \\nand Goldman Sachs to launch the innovative \\nRestore Fund, which seeks to blend responsible \\nforestry practices with carbon removal: We’re \\nworking with forestry managers to create \\nsustainably managed forests that optimize for \\nboth carbon and wood production, creating \\nrevenue from timber, and generating high-\\nquality carbon credits. Apple will invest up to \\n$200 million in projects that aim to remove \\ncarbon from the atmosphere and store it, all \\nwhile meeting clear social and environmental \\nimpact criteria and offering a financial return.  \\nIn its pilot phase, the Restore Fund has a goal  \\nof removing at least 1 million metric tons of \\ncarbon dioxide per year.\\n\\nAs the projects in the Restore Fund come \\nonline, we’re also working to address difficult-\\nto-avoid emissions in the short term. In fiscal \\nyear 2021, 167,000 metric tons of carbon \\ncredits were retired from the Chyulu Hills \\nproject in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality \\nfor our corporate emissions in fiscal year \\n2021. And we purchased carbon credits from \\ntwo additional projects to offset a total of \\n500,000 metric tons of direct emissions across \\nour value chain: a REDD+ coastal conservation \\nproject in Guatemala and a reforestation project \\nin Guizhou Province of China.

Part of Apple’s \\nRacial Equity and Justice Initiative (see page 60), the Accelerator aims to help combat \\nsystemic barriers to opportunity, while also advancing innovative solutions for communities \\nmost impacted by climate change. \\n\\nWe selected our first class of 15 businesses on the cutting edge of green technology and \\nclean energy to begin the program in August 2021. The three-month program included live \\nvirtual sessions, online courses on supply chain management, supplier diversity, financial \\nand legal subjects, as well as one-on-one mentorship with an Apple expert on topics from \\nrenewable energy to responsible sourcing.\\n\\nThe goal of the Impact Accelerator is to better position the participating companies for \\ngrowth, to improve their abilities to take on larger contracts, and to expand their customer \\nbase — all while fostering their environmental commitment. For example, last October we \\nannounced that we will be working with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority, formed by six \\nSioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources, on a project to create  \\na wind power development in the Midwest. And following the success of this year’s class, \\nour efforts continue.

It can be stressful if something at Apple \\nhas a negative effect on well-being, violates an Apple policy, or interferes with someone’s \\nability to do their best work. There are several ways team members can report a concern:\\n\\nManagers: Talking to a manager is a good place to start. A large part of their responsibility \\nis to support their team members. If a team member is not comfortable bringing a concern \\nto their manager, they can discuss it with any manager at Apple.\\n\\nPeople Support: This dedicated team specializes in supporting Apple team members with \\nwork-related topics. They can answer questions, clarify a policy, or suggest resources or \\noptions to help resolve a problem.  \\n\\nBusiness Conduct: Team members can contact the Business Conduct team via phone, \\nemail, or a third party. They will review the concern and share it with the appropriate internal \\npartners. Read more on page 72.\\n\\nPeople Business Partner: Team members can discuss the issue with their People \\nBusiness Partner (PBP), particularly if it’s related to your team or organization.\\n\\nTeam members are encouraged to raise their concerns in the way they feel most \\ncomfortable, internally or externally. In addition to the options above, they may also contact \\nany of the government agencies or other external organizations that address employee and \\nworkplace concerns.\\n\\nWorkplace practices \\nand\\xa0policies \\n\\nApple’s culture is built on treating everyone with \\ndignity and respect, and this focus shapes how \\nour colleagues engage with one another and \\nwith our customers and partners around the \\nworld. We’re also committed to respecting our \\nteam members’ rights as set out in our Human \\nRights Policy.\\n\\nEqual employment opportunity \\nApple is an equal opportunity employer \\ncommitted to inclusion and diversity.  \\n\\nWe take steps to provide equal opportunity \\nfor all applicants and employees, without \\nregard to race, color, ancestry, national origin, \\ncaste, religion, creed, age (over 40), mental \\nand physical disability, sex, gender (including \\npregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related \\nmedical conditions), sexual orientation, gender \\nidentity or expression, medical condition, \\ngenetic information, marital status, military \\nor protected Veteran status, an employee’s \\nreproductive health decisions or those of  \\ntheir dependents, or on any other basis \\nprotected by law. We provide reasonable \\naccommodations to applicants and employees \\nwith physical and mental disabilities. \\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   30\\n\\nHarassment and discrimination \\nWe are committed to providing a workplace free \\nof harassment or discrimination based on race, \\ncolor, ancestry, national origin, caste, sex, gender \\n(including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, \\nor related medical conditions), sexual orientation, \\ngender identity or expression, religion, creed, age \\n(over\\xa040), mental and physical disability, medical \\ncondition, genetic information, marital status, or \\nmilitary or protected Veteran status, or on any \\nother basis protected by law. We do not tolerate \\ndiscrimination or harassment of our employees or \\nthose with whom we have a business, service, or \\nprofessional relationship (including customers), \\nnor do we tolerate workplace violence of any kind. \\nRetaliation against anyone for complaining about \\nharassment or discrimination, or for participating \\nin the investigation of a complaint of harassment \\nor discrimination, is against Apple policy and will \\nnot be tolerated at Apple. \\n\\nVoluntary decision review \\nApple’s voluntary decision review enables \\nemployees to have an employment decision \\nreevaluated. This is designed to promote \\nfairness and impartiality, in line with our values \\nand policies. The reviewer will consider any  \\nnew information that indicates the decision  \\nmay not have been in accordance with our \\npolicies and guidelines. \\n\\nNon-employees  \\nand temporary workers\\nIn addition to our full-time employees, \\ntemporary workers and vendor services play an \\nimportant role on our team. Our temporary \\nworkers generally perform similar work as our \\nfull-time employees, as they are intended to \\naugment the Apple employee workforce under  \\na short to mid-term assignment. Approximately \\n\\n6 percent of our U.S. corporate workforce \\nwere temporary workers as of October 2021. \\nTemporary workers have the same opportunity \\nto be considered as all other applicants to any \\nApple job posting whether that opportunity is \\na conversion of their current role or a role they \\nfound on our job site. And in our retail business, \\nwe have a strong record of hiring temporary \\nworkers as full- and part-time employees. \\n\\nOur outsourced services with workers provided \\nvia vendors generally perform work that can be \\ndifferent from that performed by our permanent \\nemployees. This workforce is intended to \\nsupport business needs where specific skills \\nare required and the vendors have the ability  \\nto scale with our varied business needs.\\n\\nPay and benefits: For vendor services, pay \\nrates are managed by the vendor. Various \\nbenefits, including but not limited to healthcare, \\nare offered to these workers through their \\nemployer or staffing agencies. Vendors are \\nalso accountable to Apple’s Supplier Code \\nof Conduct, which requires that our staffing \\nagencies are compliant with all current local \\nand national legislation and employment laws, \\nincluding wage and benefits requirements, for \\ntheir employees (see page 37 or People and \\nEnvironment in Our Supply Chain).\\n\\nRaising concerns: In many cases there are \\nmultiple avenues for non-Apple workers to \\nreport problems anonymously, including internal \\nprocesses with their employer and the Apple \\nBusiness Conduct Helpline (see page 72).\\n\\nPerformance: Vendor performance is \\nreviewed and evaluated by the vendor \\nmanagement based on feedback sometimes \\nreceived from Apple managers, Procurement, \\nand/or Supplier Responsibility. \\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Apple’s \\nCOVID-19 \\nresponse\\n\\nProtecting each other’s health\\nAt every stage of the pandemic, our first \\npriority has always been the health of our \\nteams, customers, and communities.

In 2020, we introduced an \\nenhancement to our Code and Standards \\nspecifically addressing Infectious Disease \\nPreparedness and Response (IDPR). IDPR \\ncontains a set of new requirements resulting \\nfrom our learnings during the pandemic, which \\nwill help our suppliers better prepare for and \\nbe ready to respond to an infectious disease \\noutbreak at their facility. As part of the rollout \\nof IDPR in fiscal year 2021, we conducted \\nmore than 200 onsite and remote specialized \\nassessments to verify suppliers’ compliance \\nwith COVID-19 control protocols in order to \\ndrive improvement when necessary.\\n\\nWe also continue to assess any existing gaps \\nat supplier facilities, and identify opportunities \\nto work with those in higher-risk areas to \\nhelp make their facilities safer. This includes \\nworking with third-party suppliers to redesign \\nand reconfigure factory floor plans where \\nnecessary, implementing flexible working hours \\nto maximize interpersonal space, implementing \\nenhanced deep cleaning protocols, and \\ndeploying masks and sanitizers. In fiscal year \\n2021, we also encouraged our suppliers’ \\nemployees to get vaccinated and boosted \\nwhere available.\\n\\nWe also partnered with NGOs to help further \\nsupport supplier employees, as well as those \\nworking deeper in our supply chain, particularly \\nthose from vulnerable groups. We worked with \\nthe International Organization for Migration \\n(IOM) — the world’s leading organization \\nproviding services to migrant workers — to \\nprovide support to migrant workers impacted \\n\\nby the pandemic. With support from Apple, \\nour long-time partner Pact, an international \\ndevelopment organization, prepared and \\ncoordinated activities to prevent the spread of \\nCOVID-19 in several mining communities in the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

At the beginning of the \\npandemic, when personal protective equipment \\nwas in short supply, we sourced through our \\nsupply chain and donated more than 30 million \\nmasks for healthcare workers worldwide. \\nWe also launched a company-wide effort to \\nproduce and ship over 10 million face shields. \\nThese face shields were delivered to sites \\naround the world, from New York Presbyterian \\nHospital in the U.S. to the Ministry of Health \\nin Zambia. \\n\\nAdditionally, we have also donated over \\n$10 million to the World Health Organization’s \\nCOVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. We also \\nmatched employee donations two-to-one to \\nsupport COVID-19 response efforts worldwide. \\nWe awarded $10 million from our Advanced \\nManufacturing Fund to COPAN diagnostics, \\na market leader in sample collection kits, \\nthat rapidly accelerated their ability to supply \\nsample collection kits to hospitals in the U.S. \\nfor COVID-19 testing. And our partnership \\nwith Product (RED) also supported COVID-19 \\nresponse (see page 65).\\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   32\\n\\nIn partnership with the White House \\nCoronavirus Task Force and the CDC, we \\nreleased an app and a website that guided \\nAmericans through a series of questions about \\ntheir health and exposure to determine if they \\nshould seek care for COVID-19 symptoms, \\nproviding CDC recommendations on next \\nsteps, including guidance on social distancing \\nand self-isolating, how to closely monitor \\n\\nsymptoms, recommendations on testing, \\nand when to contact a medical provider. \\nAnd we collaborated with Google to create a \\nnew exposure notification system for global \\ngovernments and health agencies, with user \\nprivacy and security central to its design, to \\nhelp fight the pandemic.\\n\\nCollaboration with our suppliers helps them make sure they’re taking every necessary \\nprecaution to keep people safe at work. \\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Health and safety at Apple \\n\\nWe’re dedicated to protecting our team \\nmembers and our customers everywhere \\nwe operate — a responsibility COVID-19 has \\nbrought into even greater focus. At every \\nstage of the pandemic, we’ve made decisions \\nbased on the latest local data and public health \\nguidance, and we share lessons across our \\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety (EHS) teams \\nglobally so we can continuously improve our \\nsafety programs. \\n\\nProtecting our people \\nWe’re always working hard to make sure our \\nworkers are safe no matter where they are \\nwhen they’re conducting business for Apple. \\nWe abide by EHS requirements in every country \\nwhere we operate and are dedicated to doing \\neverything we can to support the safety and \\nwell-being of our global teams. \\n\\nManaging work-related hazards and risks \\nTo help ensure the safety of our workers and \\ncustomers, we put procedures in place to \\nidentify workplace risks and mitigate possible \\nhazards. We support and protect employees \\nin lower hazard spaces, and we put risk-\\nspecific programs in place for those working \\nin higher hazard environments, including safe \\nsystems of work, chemical management, \\nlaser safety, equipment and machinery safety, \\nhazardous materials management, and \\nelectrical safety. Employees can request to \\nhave their workspaces individually inspected \\nto review hazards and controls, including \\nergonomics evaluations. \\n\\nApple implements a hierarchy of control \\nfor significant risks, which centers on \\nelimination, substitution, engineering controls, \\nadministrative controls, and personal protective \\nequipment (PPE).\\n\\nAs one example, Apple EHS regularly assesses \\nhazards at our research labs based on their \\nchemical, equipment, laser, and other hazards. \\nApproximately 9 percent of our labs are \\nconsidered “complex,” meaning that they \\ncontain high-hazard processes and equipment. \\nThese assessments help teams understand \\nwhich EHS programs and controls must be \\nput in place to mitigate risks. In 2021, Apple \\ncompleted hazard assessments in over 2500 \\nresearch labs globally.\\n\\nOur EHS teams identify and provide team \\nmembers with appropriate PPE for specific \\nhazards. This PPE is provided at no cost and \\nwith training on correct use. For example, \\nour hearing conservation programs include \\nevaluation and control of occupational \\nexposures to noise, and hearing protection is \\navailable for processes, areas, and tasks with \\npotential high noise exposures. Additionally, \\nEHS conducts mandatory health checks for \\nemployees where they’re needed.\\n\\nWe invest in new technologies as we continue \\nto manage potential risks across our operations, \\nincluding our Apple-owned manufacturing \\nsites. Our standards, programs, trainings, \\nprocedures, and other safeguards are managed \\nby trained EHS professionals, and where \\nrequired, we also translate EHS procedures into \\nlocal languages for our team members. \\n\\nRisks identified from incidents, injuries, and \\nnon-routine events are addressed expeditiously \\nto identify and implement appropriate \\ncorrective and preventative actions, and we \\nintegrate our learnings into future program \\ndevelopment and training. Lessons learned \\nare routinely communicated across Apple’s \\nEHS team and potentially affected operations, \\nand they are used to inform updates to existing \\npolicies and procedures.\\n\\nEmployees and managers can report incidents, \\nnear-misses, and observations — including \\nnewly identified hazards and risks—through \\nan internal iOS app. Incident responses are \\naddressed by Apple’s EHS team through a \\nconsistent process that connects employees \\nwith care and support, while identifying \\ncorrective actions where appropriate to prevent \\nfuture occurrences. \\n\\nWaste management\\nApple is committed to minimizing resource \\nuse and the associated generation of non-\\nhazardous or hazardous waste. Where \\npossible, Apple implements a waste hierarchy \\nof prevention, waste reduction at the source, \\nreuse of materials, recycling, energy recovery, \\nand landfilling as a last resort.\\n\\nWe maintain our commitment to the safe and \\nresponsible management of hazardous waste, \\nboth onsite and offsite. Any facility that does \\nnot meet our requirements is replaced by \\nanother approved waste management facility.\\n\\nWe made progress in 2021 at sites around \\nthe world:\\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   33\\n\\nU.S.: Thirteen of the Treatment, Storage, and \\nDisposal Facilities (TSDFs) we utilize in the U.S. \\nwere audited in 2021 to confirm that the waste \\nis treated, recycled, or incinerated within the \\ngoverning safety standards for health and the \\nenvironment. Eight disposal facility reviews \\nwere completed by vendors under Apple \\nmanagement, and we reviewed five other sites \\nvia third-party audit reports. At one of our major \\nresearch labs in Santa Clara Valley, the empty \\ncontainer management program resulted in a \\n3 percent reduction of lab debris for hazardous \\nwaste streams.\\n\\nUnited Kingdom: Through an internal initiative \\nto further strengthen waste management, \\nproduct site-specific waste initiatives \\nachieved a 97 percent diversion from landfill \\nand a 0.4 tonnes of waste/1002, both \\nexceeding requirements.\\n\\nIreland: The Cork Campus is ECVP 2799 Zero \\nWaste to Landfill Certified annually and has had \\nno material landfilled in the past five years.\\n\\nErgonomics\\nIn 2021, we continued to support our global \\nteam members working from home office, \\nApple office, and non-office settings. \\n\\nThe Apple ergonomics program is heavily \\nfocused on preventative measures to reduce \\nthe risk of work-related musculoskeletal \\ndisorders (WMSDs). This includes ergonomics \\ntraining sessions for our team members and \\nproviding input into the purchase or design \\nof work equipment, systems, and facilities to \\nensure that they meet ergonomic standards to \\nprovide the best levels of efficiency, comfort, \\nhealth, and safety for anyone using them. Our \\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##ergonomics trainings and self-assessment \\nsupport are aimed at creating an awareness \\nof ergonomic risk factors for WMSDs, how to \\nprevent them, and how to proactively request \\nfor adjustments to workstations. \\n\\nWe completed over 10,000 individual support \\nrequests for our team members working from \\nhome, along with those who returned to Apple \\noffices and Apple Store locations. Support \\nincluded tailored guidance and feedback, \\nequipment recommendations, and 1:1 virtual \\nor in-person assessments. In addition, over \\n3000 employees participated in various \\ntraining sessions. \\n\\nOur industrial, warehouse, and other non-\\noffice operations teams were supported with \\napproximately 400 ergonomic risk assessments \\nand 76 lab screenings. The assessments \\nevaluated risk factors such as repetition, \\nforce, posture, and duration, while reviewing \\nthe interaction of the team member with \\nnew machines, equipment, work processes, \\nand workspaces.\\n\\nEmergency preparedness and response \\nBeyond COVID-19, we supported the response \\nto dozens of crisis events in 2021, including \\nfires, severe weather, and civil unrest. Our \\nresponses focused on the safety of our \\nemployees and business continuity. We \\nactivated 31 crisis management teams (CMTs) \\nto manage the most severe events, and 120 \\nadditional incidents were supported without \\nfull CMTs.\\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   34\\n\\nAll team members can sign up for Apple’s \\nEmergency Alert system, enabling them to be \\nnotified of local emergencies and to indicate \\nwhether they are safe or need help. Disaster \\nsupplies are available at our facilities. All Apple \\ncampuses with over 1000 employees have \\nFacility Response and Recovery Plans, which \\nprovide a comprehensive approach to the safety \\nand support of our employees while minimizing \\nbusiness interruption. Site-specific Emergency \\nResponse Plans have been implemented \\nglobally. These plans are communicated to all \\nemployees, and trainings and drills are held at \\nleast annually. And our employees are trained \\nin emergency response, allowing them to react \\nquickly while supporting the safety of our team \\nmembers and customers. \\n\\nIn 2021, we completed over 200 emergency \\nresponse drills, which were supported by \\n2700 trained Emergency Response Team \\n(ERT) members. We expect to increase the \\nfrequency of these drills, depending on \\nCOVID-19 restrictions. \\n\\nWith the care and support of our employees \\nand customers in mind, we deployed Automatic \\nExternal Defibrillator (AED) stations across \\nour global retail stores in 2021. And to ensure \\nthat our team members could effectively use \\nthis new tool, we provided AED training for our \\nteam members.\\n\\nAll campuses and key sites have disaster supplies \\nto match localized risks. As Apple’s footprint \\ngrows, sites are evaluated and supplies are \\nadded as needed. As one example, in 2021, we \\nlaunched earthquake preparedness campaigns \\nfor employees across the western United States \\nand Japan. We conducted outreach to provide \\nemployees with information, tools, and resources, \\nand we held drills in some offices.\\n\\nWe’re always working hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are when \\nthey’re conducting business for Apple. \\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Apple’s 2022 ESG Report   35\\n\\nOur EHS management systems are designed to provide a safe environment for teams \\nacross Apple.\\n\\nEHS management systems \\nTo provide a safe and sustainable environment \\nfor our teams, our EHS programs are built to \\nshare information about risks, requirements,  \\nand expectations for all workers.\\n\\nOur EHS policy outlines our commitment \\nto workplace safety and environmental \\nstewardship, and it establishes the principles \\nthat integrate effective EHS practices into all \\naspects of our business.

This includes \\ncontinuing to expand our scope to conduct \\nindependent, third-party assessments of a \\ngrowing number of suppliers that support \\nour business outside of manufacturing. Last \\nyear, we increased our engagement and \\nexpanded the application of our Code and \\nStandards to suppliers supporting newer areas \\nof Apple’s business, including those that work \\nwith our content services like Apple TV+ and \\nApple\\xa0Fitness+.\\n\\nHow we stay engaged with suppliers\\n\\nCode of conduct  \\n\\nassessments\\n\\nEarly  \\nengagement\\n\\nOngoing  \\ntraining\\n\\nSpecialized  \\nassessments\\n\\nInvestigations\\n\\nCapability building\\n\\nbeen taken to prevent a reoccurrence.

In the event that a \\nsupplier is unwilling or unable to improve their \\noperations to meet our requirements, they risk \\nremoval from our supply chain. Since 2009, we \\nhave directed the removal of 24 manufacturing \\nsupplier facilities and 170 smelters and refiners \\nfrom our supply chain for being unwilling or \\nunable to sufficiently improve their operations \\nto meet our requirements.\\n\\nResults of our assessments are detailed in our \\nPeople and Environment in Our Supply Chain \\nReport beginning on page 91. \\n\\nThese assessments also include unannounced \\nassessments and unannounced visits \\nin response to workers’ grievances and \\nallegations, or to verify risks at supplier facilities \\nbased on predictive analytics. In fiscal year \\n2021, 211 unannounced assessments and \\ninvestigations were conducted where the \\nsupplier facility was provided no advance notice \\nof our arrival. This is nearly double the number \\nconducted in 2020.\\n\\nIn addition to third-party Code of Conduct \\nassessments, we require many of our suppliers \\nto also undergo the Responsible Business \\nAlliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program \\n(VAP), a facility-wide, third-party assessment \\n\\nwidely used by the industry. A total of 99 RBA \\nVAP assessments were completed in fiscal year \\n2021 at Apple supplier sites.\\n\\nIf we uncover non-compliance in the course \\nof any assessment or engagement, we take \\nprompt action so that suppliers not only correct \\nand remedy the issue, but make meaningful, \\nlong-term changes to their systems and \\nprocesses. We do this through a Corrective \\nAction Plan (CAP), during which 30-, 60-, and \\n90-day check-ins with Apple are required.  \\nWe then conduct our Corrective Action \\nVerification (CAV) process to verify that all \\ncorrective actions have been successfully \\nimplemented, and necessary steps have \\n\\nSupplier employees at Final Assembly in the U.S.\\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Partnerships that accelerate progress\\nWe are collaborating with industry associations, \\ncivil society organizations, and multi-\\nstakeholder initiatives around the world to \\npromote best practices, to listen to and learn \\nfrom others’ perspectives and experiences, and \\nto scale innovative solutions, helping everyone \\nto achieve progress at a more rapid pace. See \\npage 32 of the People and Environment in Our \\nSupply Chain Report for more detail on the \\norganizations we work with.\\n\\nLabor and human rights  \\nin the supply chain \\n\\nPeople come first in everything we do. Our \\ncommitment to protecting the people in our \\nsupply chain has been unwavering, anchored \\nby a simple set of beliefs: People deserve to be \\ntreated with dignity and to know their rights. \\nThey should be able to speak up if those rights \\nare not being respected — and to know and \\nexpect that when they do, we will listen and act. \\n\\nWe’re committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain.\\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   40\\n\\nWe are committed to respecting the rights of \\nevery individual in our supply chain — just like \\nwe do for our team members, customers, and \\nother partners — and more broadly, to working \\nwith others to share our tools and the lessons \\nwe’ve learned, and to empowering everyone to \\nachieve progress more rapidly.\\n\\nListening to workers\\nEffective grievance channels, ongoing worker \\nmanagement communications, and supplier \\nemployee feedback are essential to ensuring \\nrespect for worker rights and maintaining \\nsafe and healthy workplaces. Whether \\nthrough social dialogue and formal employee \\nrepresentation, workplace satisfaction \\nsurveys, anonymous hotlines, focus groups, \\nor interviews during annual assessments, the \\nfeedback we receive directly from supplier \\nemployees helps us ensure labor and human \\nrights are respected throughout our global \\nsupply chain. We also use this feedback \\nto address emerging risks, improve rights \\ntraining for supplier employees and supplier \\nmanagement, and to continually strengthen our \\nCode and Standards.\\n\\n•  Rights awareness: We believe that \\n\\nprotection starts with rights awareness, \\nand since 2008, more than 23.6 million \\nsupplier employees have been trained on \\ntheir workplace rights. Under our Code and \\nStandards, suppliers are required to provide \\nemployees with training on their workplace \\nrights. This training is generally conducted \\nduring new employee orientation, and \\ncovers international labor standards, local \\nlabor laws, environmental health and safety, \\nand the protections required by our Code \\nand Standards\\n\\n•  Feedback channels: Supplier employee \\ninterviews are an important part of every \\nassessment conducted. Each year, we \\ninterview tens of thousands of supplier \\nemployees in their local language and \\nwithout their managers present, to determine \\nwhether or not their experience on the job \\naligns with auditors’ observations during \\nassessments. In fiscal year 2021, despite \\nthe ongoing challenges presented by \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, we interviewed \\n87,626 workers in our supply chain — over \\n35,000 more than were interviewed in the \\nprevious fiscal year. \\n\\n  Our Code and Standards require effective \\n\\n \\n\\nworker feedback channels, including \\ngrievance mechanisms, at all supplier sites. \\nWe also provide third-party anonymous \\nhotlines, which are also available to our \\nemployees (see page 72), and the ability to \\ncontact the Apple Environment and Supply \\nChain Innovation (ESCI) team directly at any \\ntime and in any language. When an issue is \\nraised, we require supplier management to \\nimmediately investigate and to resolve the \\nissue in a timely manner.\\nIn 2021, we launched a grievance hotline \\nawareness campaign, and its initial rollout \\nresulted in a 22 percent increase in utilization \\nof these third-party hotlines. The reports \\nwe received from supplier employees via \\nhotlines in 2021 included issues related to \\nwages and benefits, employee relations, \\namenities at supplier facilities, workforce \\nstability, and health and safety. In each case, \\nwe investigated and worked directly with the \\nsuppliers to drive improvement and correct \\nany compliance issues found.

In 2021, we anonymously \\nsurveyed 264,963 supplier employees in \\n191 facilities across Greater China, India, \\nIreland, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, \\nUK, U.S., and Vietnam about their workplace \\nexperiences — nearly double the number of \\nsupplier employees surveyed last fiscal year. \\nAs a result, suppliers took 3944 actions, \\nincluding better commute options, increasing \\nwages and bonuses, offering better food \\nvariety, and skill development opportunities \\nfor entry-level managers.\\n\\nResponsible labor recruitment\\nOur Code and Standards, and the protections \\nthey provide, apply equally to all workers, \\nregardless of a person’s job, geographic \\nlocation, or how they enter our supply chain \\n— and this commitment begins even before \\na worker ever enters our supply chain. This \\nincludes zero tolerance for forced labor. \\n\\nWe implement strict policies and procedures \\nwith our suppliers to protect workers in our \\nsupply chain from forced labor. This includes \\nselecting suppliers for assessments based \\non factors, such as their geographic location, \\nwhich may put them at higher risk of forced \\nlabor violations, as well as their previous \\nperformance and/or history of violations or \\nallegations. Suppliers may also receive additional \\nspecialized assessments based on the nature \\nof their business or employee population, such \\nas those that employ Foreign Contract Workers, \\nand those located in higher risk migration \\ncorridors. Our Code and Standards also require \\nthat all supplier employees have an effective \\nmechanism to report grievances. In addition, \\nwe provide third-party anonymous hotlines and \\nthe ability to contact the Apple Environment and \\nSupply Chain Innovation (ESCI) team directly at \\nany time and in any language. When an issue \\nis raised, supplier management is required to \\npromptly investigate and to resolve the issue in a \\ntimely manner.\\n\\nWe strictly prohibit any form of involuntary labor \\nthroughout our worldwide supply chain and look \\nfor evidence of it in every supplier assessment \\nwe conduct, including unannounced \\nassessments. Last year, we conducted more \\nthan 1100 assessments, and found no instances \\nwhere anyone was forced to work in our \\nsupply chain. \\n\\nWe did discover two cases in Taiwan in which \\npeople paid recruitment fees to secure their \\njob, which is a violation of our Code. We \\nrequired the supplier to directly repay their \\nemployees in full, and verified repayment \\nthrough a third-party auditor. The payment of \\nrecruitment fees, withholding an employee’s \\npassport or personal identity documents, \\nor restricting an employee’s freedom of \\nmovement are Core Violations of our Code \\nand Standards — the most serious level of \\nCode violations. If we discover workers have \\npaid recruitment fees at any point on their \\nemployment journey to an Apple supplier, we \\nrequire supplier management to take prompt \\naction to provide remedy to those affected \\nby directly repaying their workers for any and \\nall fees, even if the supplier was unaware \\nthat their employees had paid recruitment \\nfees. From 2008 through fiscal year 2021, \\nour suppliers have repaid $33.2 million in \\nrecruitment fees directly to 37,322 workers.\\n\\nFinally, in collaboration with the International \\nOrganization for Migration (IOM) and the \\nResponsible Business Alliance (RBA), we \\nexpanded our Responsible Labor Recruitment \\nToolkit to more than 39 additional supplier \\nfacilities in 10 countries, reaching nearly 77,000 \\nworkers globally, with 66 percent of those \\nworking on Apple production lines.\\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Introduction \\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\nOur People\\n\\nSuppliers Customers\\n\\nCommunities\\n\\nGovernance\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\nApple’s 2022 ESG Report   42\\n\\nHow we  \\nwork to \\nprevent forced \\nlabor in our \\nsupply chain\\n\\nApple has zero tolerance for forced \\nlabor.

Our \\nstandards often go above and beyond legal \\nrequirements to protect people from forced \\nlabor risks.\\n\\n  Aligning with international frameworks.\\n\\n Apple policies and our supplier requirements align with \\ninternational labor and human rights standards, including those \\nof the International Labour Organization, the United Nations \\nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), and \\nthe Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development.\\n\\n  The Apple Human Rights Policy\\n\\n Our Human Rights Policy outlines how we treat everyone, \\nincluding our customers, employees, business partners,  \\nand the people across every level of our supply chain. \\nRead the Apple Human Rights Policy\\n\\n \\n\\n The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier \\nResponsibility Standards\\n Our supplier requirements contain strict standards for \\nresponsible labor recruitment, and apply to all suppliers, \\nprotecting workers globally. We go above and beyond legal \\nrequirements in many places by strictly prohibiting labor \\nrecruitment in regions where we cannot conduct adequate  \\ndue diligence and by maintaining a zero recruitment fees policy, \\nbecause we believe no one should pay to secure a job. \\n Read the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct \\nand Supplier Responsibility Standards\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n To address forced labor risks at its roots,  \\nwe know that our work has to begin before \\npeople enter our supply chain.\\n\\n  Thorough mapping informs our strategy.\\n\\n An effective strategy requires deep understanding of our \\nsupply chain. To date, we have mapped over 1000 labor \\nrecruitment agencies that work with our suppliers across \\n32\\xa0countries.\\n\\n  A leading strategy requires leading tools.\\n\\n The Apple Responsible Labor Recruitment Toolkit, developed \\nin partnership with the International Organization for \\nMigration, provides suppliers and their labor agencies with \\neasy-to-use tools that help them effectively manage and \\nreport data, mitigating forced labor risks before people even \\nenter our supply chain. In addition to providing hands-on \\ntraining, we are making these tools openly available for others \\nto use.\\n\\n  Awareness is power.\\n\\n We require our suppliers to provide their employees with \\ntraining on their workplace rights on their first day on the \\njob. This helps to ensure that every person is aware of \\ntheir rights and what to do if they’re not being respected, \\nwhich includes the ability to anonymously contact Apple \\ndirectly. Foreign Contract Workers, who make up a very \\nsmall percentage of people in our supply chain, also receive \\ntraining prior to leaving their home country, as well as upon \\narriving in their destination country. To date, our suppliers \\nhave provided workplace rights training to over 23.6 million \\npeople. In addition, last year we directly engaged with over \\n350,000 people in our supply chain to learn more about their \\nworkplace experience. \\n\\n \\n\\nInvesting in consistent improvement.\\n Through our new Supplier Employee Development Fund, \\nwe’re investing $50M to expand programs designed \\nto continue to improve the rights training experience, \\nworker voice platforms, and supplier employee education \\nopportunities.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n3   We hold suppliers accountable.\\n Once we’ve implemented thorough \\npreventative measures, independent, \\nthird-party assessments verify that our \\nsuppliers are meeting our standards. \\nLooking for evidence of forced labor is part \\nof every supplier assessment. If we find any \\nviolations of our Code and Standards, we \\ntake swift action to remedy the issue and \\nimprove their operations.\\n\\n  A close look.\\n\\n We regularly conduct independent, third-party assessments, \\nincluding surprise assessments, of our suppliers, verifying \\ncompliance with over 500 points across our standards. This \\nincludes an extensive document review to be sure all hiring \\nand personnel records are in place and accurate. In addition \\nto specialized forced labor assessments for at-risk suppliers, \\nwe also require many suppliers to participate in facility-wide \\nassessments, such as the Validated Assessment Program, \\nto verify performance across the supplier’s entire business. \\nIn the event that we find gaps in a supplier’s compliance \\nor capabilities, we require them to implement a Corrective \\nAction Plan. To date, our assessments have covered 94 \\npercent of our direct manufacturing spend. \\n\\n  We investigate every report.\\n\\n In addition to thoroughly assessing our suppliers’ performance \\nin upholding our standards, we also receive reports from the \\npress, governments, civil society, and people in our supply \\nchain, and we encourage the public to report concerns via \\nhttps://www.apple.com/uk/supplier-responsibility/. We \\ninvestigate every report, and frequently have Apple teams \\nonsite within 24 hours.\\n\\n  Swift action and steep penalties.\\n\\n Forced labor in any form is a Core Violation (the most serious \\nviolation level) of our requirements. If a Core Violation is \\ndiscovered, the supplier’s CEO is notified and the supplier \\nis immediately placed on probation, pending the successful \\ncompletion of a Corrective Action Plan. Probation can include \\nno new projects, no new business, and termination of existing \\nbusiness. In addition to commercial penalties, if a supplier is \\nunable or unwilling to meet our standards, they risk removal \\nfrom our supply chain. Since 2009, we have directed the \\nremoval of 24 manufacturing supplier facilities and 170 \\nsmelters and refiners for failure to meet our requirements.\\n\\n  Action this year.\\n\\n In FY21, across more than 1100 assessments, we found \\nno instances where anyone was forced to work in our \\nsupply chain. We did find two cases where employees of \\nthe same supplier in Taiwan paid recruitment fees. Per our \\nrequirements, the supplier directly repaid their employees for \\nthose fees. To date, our suppliers have directly repaid $33.2M \\nin recruitment fees to 37,322 of their employees.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n4  \\n\\n We track progress  \\nand report transparently.\\n Consistent improvement requires \\ntransparency and accountability.

When contracting with suppliers, we use our \\npurchasing power to increase diversity in our supply chain and change outdated \\nnorms that hurt those who are underrepresented in their field or industry. \\n\\nApple’s award-winning Supplier Diversity program, established in 1993, actively \\nengages suppliers from historically underrepresented communities. \\n\\nWe have policies and procedures that require diverse supplier participation during \\nearly-stage sourcing, key performance indicators to measure company success, \\nand diversity awareness trainings for our global sourcing team members and related \\nApple business units. \\n\\nIn 2016, Apple was the first Silicon Valley–based company to be invited  \\ninto the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR) in recognition of our long-standing  \\ncommitment to promoting diversity within our supplier base. BDR celebrates \\ncorporations that achieved spending of at least $1 billion with minority- and  \\nwoman-owned businesses. \\n\\nIn calendar year 2021, Apple spent over $7.1 billion with diverse suppliers around the \\nworld. Our Supplier Diversity program offers support to participating suppliers and \\nseeks active engagement in industry diversity leadership activities. For example, \\nsupplier development has been a long-standing commitment within Apple’s supply \\nchain, which is facilitated internally and externally. Externally, we partner with major \\nuniversities to provide executive development and capacity building to key diverse \\nsuppliers. And we’re proud to have supported Michigan State University and \\nHoward University on creating their first programs for diverse supplier development.\\n\\nA highlight of 2021 was that for the first time we engaged diverse suppliers  \\nin North America in manufacturing accessories for some of Apple’s most well-\\nknown products. \\n\\nWe’re also promoting diversity in the companies with which we do business. \\nFor example, our agreements with our primary construction suppliers require \\nthe reporting of their efforts to include diverse subcontractors on all Apple-\\nrelated\\xa0projects. \\n\\nAs a result of our efforts, we were chosen as Corporation of the Year by the National \\nMinority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) in October 2021.

We also work with international \\nstandards organizations to expand equal \\naccess to information and functionality while \\nworking to protect and improve the rights, \\ninclusion, and equity of people with disabilities. \\nApple follows policy developments and shares \\nits best practices with regulators, governments, \\nand organizations, including the World Health \\nOrganization (WHO) and the European \\nDisability Forum (EDF).\\n\\nWorking with the World Federation of the \\nDeaf, the American Council of the Blind, the \\nCerebral Palsy Foundation, and the National \\nAssociation of the Deaf, Apple proposed the \\nadoption of accessibility-themed emoji to \\nthe Unicode Consortium, the global body in \\ncharge of setting character standards across all \\ncomputing platforms. In 2019, the consortium \\nadopted Apple’s recommendation for more \\ninclusive and representational emoji. And in \\n2021, we expanded the accessibility options for \\nMemoji to include cochlear implants, an oxygen \\ntube, and a soft helmet.\\n\\nInclusive design\\n\\nBuilding on our accessibility work, we’ve \\nalways believed that in order to create the most \\npersonal technology in the world, we must \\nconsider the full range of human experiences. \\nAll across Apple there is a sustained \\ncommitment to making products more inclusive \\nfor a wide range of diverse groups. Apple \\n\\nengineers work hand in hand with teams across \\nthe business to help solve unique problems \\nothers seldom think about. \\n\\nFor example, with iOS 14.5, Siri no longer has a \\ndefault voice, allowing users to choose the voice \\nthat speaks to them when they first set up their \\ndevice, and in English, users can now select \\nmore diverse voice options. We’re also taking \\nsteps to ensure equity in our cameras’ automatic \\nperson recognition features so that everyone \\ncan have the same extraordinary experience, \\nno matter the photographic subject’s skin color, \\nage, or gender. As a result, the machine learning \\nmodels used in camera technology must show \\nsimilar performance across various age groups, \\ngenders, ethnicities, skin tones, and other \\nattributes. We’ve also published research  \\non this work to help others learn from it.\\n\\nBeyond our own products and services, \\nwe’ve developed machine learning research \\nand Human Interface Guidelines to support \\ndevelopers in building inclusive apps that \\nput people first by prioritizing respectful \\ncommunication and presenting content and \\nfunctionality in ways that everyone can access \\nand understand. Some of the characteristics \\nto consider include age, gender and gender \\nidentity, race and ethnicity, language and culture, \\nand social and economic context, among \\nothers. We also provide tools, documentation, \\nsample code, and design best practices to help \\ndevelopers make their apps more accessible. \\n\\nWe launched two videos during our Worldwide \\nDevelopers Conference (WWDC) in June \\n2021 on the process and practice of inclusive \\ndesign that were among the most popular of the \\nweek: The Process of Inclusive Design and The \\nPractice of Inclusive Design.\\n\\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliersCustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \\x0c##PAGE_BREAK##Education\\n\\nFor more than 40 years, we’ve worked \\nalongside educators to inspire the next \\ngeneration of learners, supporting creativity, \\nproblem-solving, communication, and \\ncollaboration.

These \\nsuppliers provide equipment, parts, and \\nmaterials for all of our core products.\\n\\nJobs in the iOS app economy\\nSince the App Store launched in 2008, the \\niOS app economy has become one of the \\nworld’s fastest-growing sectors. The App Store \\necosystem supports millions of jobs across \\nthe world, empowering entrepreneurs from \\nArgentina and Alaska to Zimbabwe and beyond. \\nIn the U.S., it supports more than 2.2 million \\njobs, and in Europe, it supports another \\n2.2 million jobs.\\n\\nIn January 2021, we launched the App Store \\nSmall Business Program, which benefits the vast \\nmajority of developers who sell digital goods and \\nservices on the App Store. The program cuts the \\nApp Store commission in half — to 15 percent — \\nfor small businesses that earned up to $1 million \\nin proceeds during the previous year. The \\nreduced commission means small entrepreneurs \\nand app makers have more resources to create \\nnew jobs, expand their businesses, explore \\ncutting-edge technologies, and pioneer new \\ninnovations that reach users around the world.\\n\\nGiving a donation\\nWhen our employees donate money, Apple \\nmatches their donations, on a dollar-for-dollar \\nbasis up to $10,000 per year per employee. \\nThat\\xa0way, every contribution goes further, \\nevery act inspires another, and every effort is \\namplified. Apple matches donations year-\\nround, but in times of greater need, we have \\noften increased the match to 2:1 and the match \\ncap up to $20,000 per employee.\\n\\nJob creation \\n\\nApple supports millions of jobs in countries \\naround the world, across North America, Europe, \\nAsia, Central and South America, Australia, and \\nAfrica. In the U.S., Apple is one of the biggest \\njob creators, and we continue to expand \\nour commitment to fostering innovation and \\nopportunity in the U.S. economy. We support \\n2.8 million jobs across all 50 states through direct \\nemployment, spending with U.S. suppliers and \\nmanufacturers, and the iOS app economy. In \\nApril 2021, Apple announced an acceleration \\nof its U.S. investments, with plans to make new \\ncontributions of more than $430 billion and add \\n20,000 new jobs across the country over the next \\nfive years. This includes a new North Carolina \\ncampus, which will create at least 3000 new jobs \\nin machine learning, artificial intelligence, software \\nengineering, and other cutting-edge fields.\\n\\nEmployees\\nApple has over 165,000 employees worldwide \\nthat span an increasingly wide range of roles, \\nincluding hardware and software engineering, \\nscience, construction, manufacturing, retail, \\ncustomer support, marketing, and design.\\n\\nVolunteers from retail in the San Francisco Bay Area participated in a food sort and packaging event at the \\nSan Francisco-Marin Food Bank.

Apple is carbon neutral for corporate emissions as of April 2020. \\n2.  Emissions from R&D processes.\\n3.  Beginning in FY2021, we’re accounting for scope 2 emissions from the \\n\\npurchase of district heating, chilled water, and steam.\\n\\n4.  In fiscal year 2017, we started calculating scope 3 emissions not listed in \\nthis table. In fiscal year 2021, these include electricity transmission and \\ndistribution losses amounted to about 28,000 metric tons CO2e and life \\ncycle emissions associated with renewable energy amounted to about \\n95,000 metric tons CO2e. We have not accounted for emissions resulting \\nfrom employees working from home, because we anticipated these \\nemissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving \\nour methodology. \\n\\n5.  We regularly revisit our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability \\n\\nstandards. So in fiscal year 2018, we changed how we calculate emissions \\nfrom business travel in order to better account for classes of service in air \\ntravel. As a result of this change, our scope 3 transportation emissions \\nincreased by 77 percent between 2017 and 2018. Without the methodology \\nchange, these emissions would have increased by 14 percent, which reflects \\nthe growth in our business.\\n\\n6.  Beginning in fiscal year 2020, we updated our methodology to reflect the \\n\\nimpact of COVID-19 on employee commute.\\n\\n7.  We retired 167,000 metric tons of carbon credits from the Chyulu Hills project \\n\\nin Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal \\nyear 2021. This project is certified to the VCS and CCB standards.\\n\\n8.  Because we’re committed to accuracy and transparency, we regularly refine \\nour product life cycle assessment model and sources of data. For example, \\nwe recently obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our \\nproducts are sold and used, resulting in more granularity possible for grid \\nemission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase. The  \\nnet result was an increase in our 2021 carbon footprint. When using the \\nsame level of data granularity and model as 2021, our product use carbon \\nemissions in 2021 would have been about 2.5 percent lower.\\n\\n9.  For fiscal year 2021, we retired credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya, \\n\\nand purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total \\nof 500,000 metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain. The first \\nproject, a REDD+ coastal conservation project in Guatemala, protects and \\nconserves forests from deforestation and degradation. The second project \\naims to establish forests on about 46,000 hectares of barren land that is not \\notherwise in use across seven counties in the Guizhou Province of China. \\nBoth projects are certified to the same high standards that we require for \\nprojects in the Restore Fund, including VCS and CCBS. These projects are all \\ncertified to the VCS and CCB standards.\\n\\n10. Due to rounding, our gross and net carbon footprints do not always the sum \\n\\nof the subtotals disclosed above. \\n\\n Notes: For data on previous years, please reference past Environmental Progress \\nReports, available at apple.com/environment.

Beginning in FY2021, we’re accounting for the purchase of district heating, \\n\\nchilled water, and steam.\\n\\n2.    Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency \\n\\nsavings are calculated cumulatively since 2012. All efficiency measures \\nare retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented by the \\nCalifornia Energy Commission. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, corporate \\nfacilities energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climate \\ncontrols due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy. These savings are not \\nincluded in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives. \\nWe also recognize that energy use at our employees’ homes likely increased \\nduring this period. We have not accounted for this energy use, because we \\nanticipated this impact is small relative to our overall energy use and we are \\nstill evolving our methodology. \\n\\n3.    Energy savings from supplier energy efficiency improvements are reported \\nas annualized annual numbers. Prior to 2020, supplier energy savings are \\ncalculated on a calendar year basis. Beginning in 2020, supplier energy \\nsavings are calculated based on the fiscal year. \\n\\n4.    Beginning January 1, 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we use to power our \\n\\nglobal facilities is sourced from renewable energy.\\n\\n5.

All references to a year throughout \\nthe report refer to Apple’s fiscal years, unless \\n“calendar year” is specified. Apple’s fiscal year \\nis the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the \\nlast Saturday of September. \\n\\nAlignment to reporting frameworks: The \\nreport leverages reporting frameworks and \\nstandards such as the Global Reporting Initiative \\n(GRI), Sustainable Accounting Standards Board \\n(SASB), and the Task Force on Climate-related \\nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD). Apple’s ESG \\nIndex maps the disclosures in this report and \\nother Apple publications against the metrics \\nin these reporting frameworks, as relevant to \\nour business.\\n\\nData assurance: We obtain third-party \\nverification for scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse \\ngas emissions, as well as energy use, paper \\nuse, and waste and water impacts for our \\ndata centers, offices, and retail stores \\nworldwide. Apex Companies (Apex) provides \\n“reasonable assurance” — one of the highest \\nlevels of verification in the industry — for \\nthis environmental impact data.. Apex also \\nprovides “limited assurance” of scope 3 \\nrenewable energy production and avoided \\ncarbon emissions related to our Supplier \\nClean Energy Program as well as energy \\nsavings associated with our Supplier Energy \\nEfficiency Program.
